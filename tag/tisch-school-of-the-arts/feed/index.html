				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Writer/Director of Gregory Go Boom and Special Guest for Fusion’s Opening Night – Thurs. March 6th</h3>
<p>Janicza Bravo’s new short <i>Gregory Go Boom </i>is the freshest and most intriguing short out there this season (already having swept up the Grand Jury Prize for Narrative Short at Sundance). With laughs, and heart, and killer form the film goes beyond the boundaries of the newly emerging dry, dead-pan comedy genre of our generation and captures perhaps the best performance of Michael Cera’s career thus far. Recently, I had a chance to pick the brain of the woman behind the film and get to know a little bit more about Janicza’s inspiration and perspective as a writer and director – though, of course she we still have many more questions in store for her in person after screening <i>Gregory Go Boom </i>in the Cantor Film Center this Thursday at 7pm.</p>
<p><i>What was your inspiration for the story of Gregory Go Boom?</i></p>
<p>A couple of years ago I was out to dinner with my boyfriend and his uncle. Next to us was a paraplegic man. He seemed preoccupied, distracted. He was waiting for something; for someone. There was an air about him that totally grabbed my attention. In walks this woman. Blonde and very beautiful. It was clear by the look on her face that they’d been set up. She looked at him in this way that is very hard to explain. It was devastating. I didn’t see the look on his face because I couldn’t bare it. He must have been crestfallen… The film is born out of that look. The way that must have made him feel so small. The film is about being dismissed because of limitation.</p>
<p><i>What was it like getting the film made, gaining support, and building a team? Did you work with your connections from NYU in any way?</i></p>
<p>The film came together pretty fast. It had its challenges like all work does. It was produced by JASH. Jash is a comedy collective that puts out comedy content curated by Michael Cera, Sarah Silverman, Tim and Eric and Reggie Watts. My producing partner, Brett Gelman, and I pitched a few ideas and they loved <i>Gregory</i> most. We were a small team with a small budget so there was very little room for ego. The 2nd and 3<sup>rd</sup> dates that <i>Gregory</i> goes on are with Mireya Lucio and Anna Rose Hopkins who are old pals from NYU.</p>
<p><i>How did your background as a Tisch drama major guide you in this project? Do you think it gave you a unique approach to characters, story, etc. than a film background would? </i></p>
<p>I am deeply grateful for my theatre background. It influences all of my choices from framing to blocking to casting. I tend to grain towards wide shots and long takes with very little coverage. I like scenes to play out and breathe which is definitely a result of my days back at Playwright Horizons. There are no cutaways in theatre. Sometimes I wish I knew what everything on a film set was called but ultimately that’s not the kind of filmmaker I am. I am not a technical person.</p>
<p><i>How would you describe what it is like being a female filmmaker in this time?</i></p>
<p>It’s a very thrilling time. It’s nice to be among a strong crop of women. That said the conversation of being a woman filmmaker for me is not one that is devoid of race. The industry is a very male and very white. That’s a fact. It’s a fact that I use to let affect me. I felt if there wasn’t someone like me already then it meant there would never be anyone like me.</p>
<p>I can’t put into words how exciting it is that something I directed is playing at NYU. I really cherished my time there. I’ve dreamt about playing my work Cantor and directing one of the main stages. So this is truly very awesome.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On November 12<sup>th</sup>, 2013 the Sundance Institute held a one-day finance forum in Los Angeles with their allied partners of the Women in Films Initiative to give accomplished female writers, directors, and producers an overview of current film financing models. Through extensive panels on what investors search for in today’s market, case-studies on film financing successes, and training on how to garner confidence while raising money for a film, Sundance and WIF sought to challenge what they uncovered in their startling 2012 case study. The study, authored by Dr. Stacy L. Smith, analyzed over 30,000 data points over 11 years and concluded that independent narrative films rely almost entirely on a male-operated structure, female-helmed projects are perceived to lack commercial viability, and women are often viewed as lacking conviction when requesting film financing. The forum set out whole-heartedly to challenge these findings and the reflections and speeches given at the event by Ciaravalli and Green show the great strides female filmmakers are making in producing their own films and festivals at an early level.</p>
<p>Misha Green directed three well-received short films during her time at NYU Tisch and won the Fusion Film Festival competition for her short screenplay <i>In Between Days</i>. Misha went on the produce <i>In Between Days </i>as a digital short for Nylon Magazine, sign with CAA, and write and produce for multiple hit television series, including “Sons of Anarchy” and “Heroes.” Misha is currently working on adapting Colleen Curran’s “Whores on the Hill” as her directorial debut.</p>
<p>Lauren Ciaravalli graduated from Tisch just last year and was one of the co-directors of the Fusion Film Festival as well as a winner for her Sight &amp; Sound film, <i>Mrs. Sheridan</i>, her short screenplay, <i>Tryouts</i>, and her TV pilot script, <i>The Hilltop</i>. She recently created and sold the dramedy web-series <i>Max + Max</i> for PetParents TV and completed her second short film, <i>Dream Date</i>.  Lauren now lives in Los Angeles as she begins her career in scripted television as an assistant at William Morris Endeavor Entertainment.</p>
<p>As a strong leader and participant in the festival, Lauren presented the mission and methods of Fusion to celebrate both the accomplishments of women in the film industry and foster collaboration of the sexes before the forum. Lauren thanked many of the female industry mavens in the room, particularly those from our mentors at the Nantucket Film Festival for supporting the growth of Fusion in our efforts to honor everything the Women in Films Initiative stands for.</p>
