				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><em>by Amanda Saiewitz, PR Head</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">This year’s Fusion Film Festival was jam-packed with amazing panels, incredible conversations with industry professionals, and impressive displays of student work. From our Woman of the Year Reed Morano and the Showrunner Superstars panel with Amy Sherman-Palladino and Janet Tamaro to the Student Showcase and Awards Ceremony, the three-day festival overflowed with inspiration. Fusion wouldn’t be a fraction of what it is without the support and enthusiasm of our fellow NYU students, so we asked some of the 2015 competition winners to share their Fusion experiences:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/g7c7ymVHGXD7z7WDA1JgbpXPtjRHqHKZjwv0HM-BQ75Id3djiSCCRTGySCx27zEKTUfccG5USNfC94N-duI571JIcur_hNi_sDeKJZNvhCpr82omxrzio-PX2ZZnofCnz7KQ3A8" width="235px;" height="311px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">“Having been fortunate enough to participate in other festivals, we can&#8217;t express how exceptional Fusion is specifically, from the very beginning until the end. Between the thought-provoking discussions with industry leaders, to the final screening of bold and exciting work, Fusion is a festival that continues to break the mold and establish itself as a formidable celebration of great cinema. Writing our pilot [“Pass By Catastrophe”] was a tremendously enjoyable experience, and to have that experience recognized at a festival like Fusion, makes the process all the more richer. We have no doubt that our fellow honorees will continue to create works that truly say something; we can&#8217;t thank Fusion enough for including us among these artists.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Joseph Gerbino and Erica A. Hart, <em>Undergraduate Half-Hour Pilot</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">

<p><img class="alignright" alt="IMG_5877edit4_small copy.jpg" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sncqSAydnFNtofEikpHWEGWIyohx1_ig8Erj92C7nw6-hd4SuZjSco7Kj_7dxpoJXkA0ksNArNxlBTLaIzUPfaSdnPVMI0e0K1ZYPmJJ81yxDEN94xqx5yHq58ntQyG8uDQupk" width="244px;" height="235px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">“Having Adam&#8217;s Ail honored at Fusion was phenomenal, for many reasons. It was exciting for so many people to come together to celebrate the films, and it&#8217;s so gratifying to see something I put so much of myself into recognized and appreciated.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignleft" alt="AdamsAil_screen03.jpg" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DHYmAwyQMu8oD-HkkVuPtbNrexEU1LSZrU9dkbK-a1oJ3xSsHJD16EaM6ttLLkrE1dNTpvMXk4bTYlyiSQFR40xFENKnzMyeCHbXq0M780Bz6isLDYAzB2DiKkyh3Uz8_ytF-2I" width="348px;" height="196px;" />There were a lot of nebulous emotions that went in to my film that I worked hard to communicate. It&#8217;s unreal to see all these talented people gather together through the festival and see them connect to what I made. It brings a life to the film that I never anticipated!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Amelia Harvey, <em>Animation Short</em></p>

<p><img class="alignleft" alt="ReDavid b.JPG" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/f-r55RHb5Ocvo6hG_eIw4W74188gFjjNXGavelUIhx2QtmY3vVto_5x4PzVmdoDnb37kpbzKxTPN8XifCEXhHlp81S5OE0HRM4mL6wLX_D7I5LDZurAbx2KO-rH9cQu5sm_ADy8" width="293px;" height="253px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">“I attended workshops led by successful showrunners, networked with industry people and even won some cash for my One Hour Pilot, “The Doll House.” Who could ask for anything more? Well, I even got a meeting with an industry professional to discuss landing an agent. It was an awesome experience!”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“As an emerging female filmmaker, I think it&#8217;s incredible that Fusion creates not only a platform for women to present their work, but a community where women support other women.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I&#8217;m proud that the majority of crewmembers on my web series were women. This is not because I am a woman, but because these ladies were extremely qualified for their jobs. There&#8217;s an overwhelming amount of talented, hard-working, and passionate women at NYU and in the industry.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" alt="Synced Sequence Replaced.Still003.jpg" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/53YXUMwZxAVsf6MUaNY-hIvGXxFUsdltr9gVlpnrTgYd8KF7CxH0ID40l-5AxY81TxZZ94WBZQzQssPoqHe76I144sTRYsIQ_f-QqLXE5SfXPHx8NNtUBBPsx0sYiEeTWPO5YMk" width="335px;" height="190px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Fusion seeks out these individuals and aids greatly in getting their original, thought-provoking stories out to the public. I&#8217;m honored to be a part of an organization with such a noble mission.”</p>
<p>Emory Parker, <em>Web Series</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4heVQzHG4&amp;list=PL9LDX3GeMUrVFx2JIxF8siw2ni4BgDOgE">Pants Role</a>)</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Fusion not only celebrates great work by female writers and directors but also engenders it: after three years as a producer working with women on their documentary pitches, I decided to apply to the Docs-in-the-Works program with my own documentary. I had been thinking about following an exciting area of science for years &#8211; Hydrogen fuel cell technology &#8211; which will allow cars everywhere to run cleanly and will ween us off our dependence on foreign oil. The great thing about Fusion is that it not only supports women in the arts, but projects with social significance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I filmed a week of this project &#8211; my first documentary, Oil and Water &#8211; and submitted it to the Fusion Film Festival. Working with the talented documentary professor and Fusion liaison, Nilita Vachani, I sculpted my trailer and did a live 20-minute pitch to execs at HBO, VICE, POV, Chicken &amp; Egg and Impact Partners. This was more than just a pitch session: I could see palpable excitement in the audience for this subject matter and for the wonderful scientists behind it like Harry Gray. I am continuing to develop this project and film over the next 5 years as Dr. Gray and his fellow scientists attempt to bring this technology to the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignright" alt="test tube.png" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wtDFsFBxhie1RrjY1rsSTSE07Ay_mTPYh0zKikBFl8RX951LOq2MLcJecO1rif5ukVR0t7kBE3rzrXs6wlp7aa1bkxYmjhXjc3CsGigRTpbVDT-OZhtyFNxG8hcDTTnT9BZEwlI" width="285px;" height="161px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to winning the documentary film pitch competition, I also had the fortune to win the half-hour comedy TV contest with my pilot &#8220;Dating by Numbers.&#8221; There&#8217;s nothing like deadlines to help finish a project! And participating in Fusion seemed like the perfect place to start shopping my script around. I&#8217;m so glad I did, and it&#8217;s been such a great experience to be part of this festival and have the support of other kick-ass women in this industry!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dagny Looper, <em>Graduate Half-Hour Pilot</em> and <em>Docs-in-the-Works</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Ben Eisen, Editorial Staff Head</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Female-Directed Show: <i>Olive Kitteridge</i></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/favorites-year/a_560x375/" rel="attachment wp-att-2630"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2630" alt="a_560x375" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/a_560x375-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>“It baffles me, this world. I don’t want to leave it yet.” So closes HBO’s incredible four-hour miniseries that proved more vital, moving, and human than anything else I saw this year. The cast is pitch perfect, the direction empathic in its pacing, and the writing reminiscent of such greats as <i>Mrs. Dalloway </i>and John Williams’ <i>Stoner</i>. Hats off to Frances McDormand and Lisa Chodolenko for powering something so special.</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions: Jenji Kohan’s immensely entertaining and humanistic second season of <i>Orange is the New Black</i>; the gleefully absurd <i>Broad City</i>; Jill Soloway’s brutally honest family portrait in <i>Transparent</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Female Performance: Elisabeth Moss, <i>Listen Up Philip</i></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/favorites-year/a15325/" rel="attachment wp-att-2631"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2631" alt="a15325" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/a15325-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>By turns heartbreaking and strong-willed as the titular narcissist’s ex, Ashley Kane, Moss leaves no doubt she’ll keep rocking it post-<i>Mad Men</i>. Although Jason Schartzman kills it in the role he was born to play, Moss commands the screen with an even more memorable and dynamic turn, charting the emotionally taxing aftermath of a breakup. Watching her struggle to smile through tears after Philip comes and goes at will is a master class in acting.</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions: Frances McDormand’s bracingly funny and real Olive Kitteridge; Amy Landecker’s stressed out parent in <i>Louie’</i>s achingly melancholy “In The Woods”; Gaby Hoffmann’s rootless Pfefferman daughter in <i>Transparent </i>(think a more endearing and empathic Hannah Horvath).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Female-Directed Movie: <i>The Babadook</i></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/favorites-year/bab3865-edit-640x356/" rel="attachment wp-att-2632"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2632" alt="BAB3865-Edit-640x356" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/BAB3865-Edit-640x356-300x166.jpg" width="300" height="166" /></a></p>
<p>Horror and emotional honesty don’t usually go hand in hand, but director Jennifer Kent subverts convention in her deeply felt debut film. From Essie’s Davis potent performance as a conflicted mother to the consummate and tense cinematography, everything about the movie feels assured and controlled at a level most filmmakers never reach. Here’s to a long career for Kent.</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions: I haven’t been to the theater enough this year, so still need to see my sister’s favorite, <i>Obvious Child</i>, the promising and unfortunately topical <i>Selma</i>, and the Jarmuschian <i>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</i>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though undeniable strides have been made in the last 50 years in the realm of women’s rights, the film and television industry has unfortunately lagged behind. The Fusion Film Festival has teamed up with other film festivals and institutions to remedy this lag. There were a total of 3,879 feature films submitted to the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Of those, a meager 16.9% listed female directors. Keri Putnam, the Executive Director of the Sundance Institute was quoted as saying “&#8230;What we’ve already found is that if statistics tell us a story, the story being told about women filmmakers today needs work.”</p>
<p>To combat this gender discrepancy, the Sundance Institute and Women in Film have partnered up in the hopes of promoting secure careers in the film field for women. The <a href="http://www.sundance.org/programs/women-filmmakers-initiative/">Women Filmmakers Initiative</a> was thus born.</p>
<p>In getting The Women Filmmakers Initiative on its feet, the Sundance Institute collaborated with USC Annenberg by jointly researching the prevalence of women in the film industry. The Initiative has aligned with many other innovative partners such as the AFI Conservatory, Athena Film Festival, Paley Center for Media, PGA, and Women Make Movies among others. The chief aim for The Women Filmmakers Initiative in garnering information was to determine just what the first areas of concern to be addressed should be. In the end, four main goals for the 2012 year were stated as primary areas of focus: Mentorship, Finance Education, Training, and Access and Raising Awareness, and Facilitating Collaboration.</p>
<p>Women in Film and the Sundance Initiative hosted a one-day Forum on November 12, 2013 to provide female writers, directors, and producers in the film industry with current film financing models, information on what investors are seeking, and information on examples of properly financed films. The conference also provided information about how to have more confidence necessary when fundraising for a film project. Fusion’s Allied Partner status to the Initiative granted Fusion the opportunity to send a filmmaker/fellow to attend the Forum. Tisch UGFTV alum Misha Green attended in this position. Additionally Lauren Ciaravalli, a previous Fusion co-director, attended the Forum in the role of spokesperson and spoke about Fusion’s history at the Paley Center for New Media in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>As a part of The Women Filmmakers Initiative, various schools of status within the entertainment realms have been named Allied Partners of this initiative. As NYU’s very own Fusion Film Festival continues to grow, it has had the honor of being named an Allied Partner as another step towards gender equality in the film industry. Putnam has been quoted saying, “Sundance Institute has long believed in the value of diverse storytellers contributing to a vibrant culture.” Undoubtedly, this Mentorship Program is just another step closer to achieving the ultimate goal of diverse vibrancy in storytelling culture.</p>
