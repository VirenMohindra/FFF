				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the theater lights of Cantor dimmed and the Christmas music played, the entire crowd, including NYU affiliates and film industry professionals, fell into a trance only to be jolted out of it soon after. The street setting in the opening sequence of the film isn’t the standard for a &#8216;holiday movie,&#8217; but it is impactful. It is memorable. It is NYU Tisch School of the Arts Graduate Professor Kasi Lemmons&#8217; <i>Black Nativity. </i>(To read a Lemmon’s interview on Black Nativity, click <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/movies/kasi-lemmons-directs-a-big-screen-black-nativity.html?_r=0" target="_blank">HERE</a><i>). </i>Fusion Film Festival celebrated its 2013-2014 kick-off with an advanced screening of Lemmons’ film for the NYU community and invited guests.</p>
<p>Following the festivities, Fusion was treated to a Q&amp;A with some key members of the cast and crew, including Lemmons herself and <i>Black Nativity </i>producer Celine Rattray. Rattray, a prolific producer in the film world, was an empowering addition to Fusion&#8217;s Q&amp;A panel. Rattray has won a Golden Globe, received an Oscar nomination, and has produced over thirty independent films of various levels of acclaim with Sundance Film Festival, Toronto Film Festival, and Berlin International Film Festival affiliation. Before producing Lemmons&#8217; film, Rattray functioned as the Director of Marketing and Business Development for HBO and was chosen by Crain’s New York as a member of the selective &#8220;Forty Under 40&#8243; list. We are honored to report that Celine Rattray has joined Fusion&#8217;s Honorary Board.</p>
<p>In addition to Rattray and Lemmons,  Fusion was lucky enough to celebrate this event with prominent production designer Kristi Zea, and up and one of the film&#8217;s stars, Grace Gibson. Kristi Zea is a true force in the film realm. She has functioned as a production designer, costume designer, and producer of major feature films. Noteably, Zea has designed <i>Manchurian Candidate, Goodfellas, </i>and <i>Terms of Endearment </i>just to name a few. In her experience, Zea has collaborated with some of the film world greats,  such as Martin Scorsese, Sam Mendes, and James L. Brooks. Zea’s work has been nominated for an OSCAR and a BAFTA. Gibson, debuting as &#8220;Maria&#8221; in <i>Black Nativity</i>, joined the Fusion’s panel at the launch event, speaking about her break-out role in Lemmons’ film, and the powerful roots that tie her to the project.</p>
<p>To have such talented and acclaimed women as Lemmons, Rattray, Zea, and Gibson to celebrate the launch of FUSION 2014 and the call for submissions, was an exhilarating experience. Being in the presence of these influential women in the film industry was a potent and empowering reminder of Fusion&#8217;s foundation.</p>
<p>This event also marks the launch of Fusion&#8217;s festival season and the opening of submissions. Click <a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/contact/submit/">HERE</a> to learn more and submit your fantastic student films.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fusion is proud to extend honorary board membership to a true vanguard of the industry, Agnieszka Holland. Holland has crafted amazing work throughout her inspiring career as a one of Poland’s most renowned film and television writer-directors. Yet, Holland’s work and presence extend far beyond her national borders, her 1991 film <i>Europa Europa </i>having received the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. Holland has led a career of activism against cross-gender censorship in the film industry under the former communist regime in Poland while still continuing to receive critical acclaim for her films at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Fresh from directing a third Academy Award nominated film, <i>In Darkness</i>, Holland’s newest endeavor has been creating a three-part drama series for HBO, <i>Burning Bush</i>, which premiered to great acclaim at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival and is set to air in the United States in 2014. The series follows the true story of Jan Palach, the revolutionary who protested “normalization” in Czechoslovakia after the Warsaw Pact invasion of 1968.</p>
<p>As a member of our honorary board Holland joins the company of other inspirational figures in the field who inspire and support us as a festival, often lending their voices to our events and panels.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;">Last Friday, we had the pleasure of hosting an event with award-winning producer and co-founder of Chicken and Egg Pictures, Wendy Ettinger. Bringing together sixteen students from both the graduate and undergraduate Film and Television Production departments at Tisch, this “Coffee With…” series event geared its focus on documentary filmmaking and the importance of proper funding initiatives.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/COFFEE-WE1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-694" alt="Wendy Ettinger" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/COFFEE-WE1.jpg" width="3906" height="2848" /></a></p>
<p>As co-founder of Chicken and Egg Pictures, a non-profit production company that supports women filmmakers in the documentary field through grants and mentoring, Wendy has had much success in promoting films that otherwise would not have been noticed by major film production companies. Graduate school attendees who are now working on their thesis documentary features expressed concern over implementing the proper funding techniques, and whether or not to be persistent and aggressive towards their potential funders. “How do I get people to care about my project as much as I do?” asked many that morning. At which point, Wendy shared that the art of funding is an act of mutual “seduction” and that only confidence and assertiveness will convince people to support a filmmaker.</p>
<p>One graduate student noted that as difficult as it is for anyone to get their project funded, it is especially difficult for women in the industry to get noticed against their male counterparts. She shared a brief anecdote about an interview dinner she had with a potential investor, who treated the meeting as more of a date. Wendy noted that even many industry experts tend to group women filmmakers in a “pink box,” and that it’s a matter of standing your ground as a professional filmmakers and demanding respect. She shared that something as simple as bringing along a producer to a meeting or selecting a more informal location would help set proper barriers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the morning breakfast proved to be very insightful to the group of budding filmmakers. When asked by moderator and Fusion co-director, Lucy Ross, “Do you have any motto that you live by?” Wendy answered that she mostly believed that everything happens to the best. She couldn’t express enough the importance of being friendly to everyone in the industry. With her new “Game Changer” initiative, a joint venture between Impact Partners and Chicken and Egg Pictures that will aim at producing narrative films directed exclusively by women, Wendy proves to be moving forward in her achievements.</p>
