				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Amanda Saiewitz and Ben Eisen, PR and Editorial Heads</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/?attachment_id=2742" rel="attachment wp-att-2742"><img class="size-full wp-image-2742 aligncenter" alt="reed morano" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/10635751_10203698295240406_3673849286736231745_n-e1422478197949.jpg" width="360" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>In many ways, 2014 was a great year for female filmmakers. Audiences adored Gillian Robespierre’s hilarious and progressive <i>Obvious Child</i>, Jennifer Kent’s terrifyingly visceral <i>The Babadook</i>, and Ava Duvernay’s authentic and complex <i>Selma</i>. Beyond these few names, however, women were again hugely underrepresented in the industry. According to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, only 7% of the 250 top grossing domestic films had a woman at the helm. That’s 7% for half the population.</p>
<p>Now in its thirteenth year, NYU Tisch School of the Arts’ Fusion Film Festival strives to alter this shocking disparity by celebrating women in film, television, and new media, from student to icon. While Fusion rewards female directors and DPs in its festival competitions, it also promotes gender collaboration amongst crews (i.e. female director, male DP) and the rich work such balance creates. The upcoming festival, February 26-28, will feature events with TV legends Amy Sherman-Palladino and Janet Tamaro, <i>American Psycho</i>’s Mary Harron in conversation with <i>Pet Sematary</i>’s Mary Lambert, and distinguished cinematographer Reed Morano, Fusion’s “Woman of the Year.”</p>
<p>Among on-the-rise DPs, few are as impressive or as downright tenacious as Morano. Following her breakout work on <i>Frozen River</i>, she’s repeatedly proved her mettle, shooting indie success <i>The Skeleton Twins</i>, vital music doc <i>Shut Up and Play the Hits</i>,and HBO’s critically acclaimed series <i>Looking</i>. Morano’s a technical master, a gifted storyteller, and a leading exemplar of Fusion’s mission. To mark the occasion, we spoke with Morano about the industry’s gender problem, the realities of shooting while pregnant, and her proudest works.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p><b>Since you’ve been in the industry, how have you seen crew/roles for women change? </b></p>
<p>When I was an undergraduate in Film &amp; TV at NYU/Tisch School of the Arts, many of the projects I shot had male directors, and only a few had female directors. It was generally a little more male-oriented than it is now. After graduating, I was shooting and working as a key grip and I often found myself the only female out of the whole crew, except for producers. Now, I see lots of women in a broader variety of roles.</p>
<p>There’s definitely a larger conversation about this going on. Some women wish that there were more equal opportunities in terms of hiring of DPs on studio movies because now there’s more equal opportunity going on for directors in that world. I just happen to disagree because I wouldn’t want to be hired that way. I would rather be hired for my talent. I also don’t want to shoot just any studio movie. Ideally, I want the most quality scripts I can find. That’s not something that equal opportunity is going to get you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2015/02/fusions-woman-year-reed-morano-talks-industrys-gender-issue-shooting-pregnant-proudest-works/mv5bmji0mtczote4mv5bml5banbnxkftztgwmdaymdm3mde-1-_v1_sx640_sy720_/" rel="attachment wp-att-2986"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2986 aligncenter" alt="MV5BMjI0MTczOTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDAyMDM3MDE@-1._V1_SX640_SY720_" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MV5BMjI0MTczOTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDAyMDM3MDE@-1._V1_SX640_SY720_-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><b>What do you see for the future?</b></p>
<p>I see more and more female filmmakers. Look at Ava Duvernay’s Golden Globe nomination and her movie’s Oscar nom – that’s a huge deal and a big step in the right direction. You can’t expect everything to happen all at once when it’s been such a male-dominated world for so long. It’s 2015 and still no female has ever been nominated for Best Cinematography. It’s shocking, but I have to believe that’s because not enough females had been shooting up until recent years. I do think <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i> [shot by Ellen Kuras] should have been nominated and it still pisses me off that it wasn’t. I was recently at the ASC Open House in LA and I was approached by at least 15 up and coming female cinematographers. That, to me, is exactly what we need &#8211; to saturate the industry as women filmmakers &#8211; and it’s a sign that times and storytelling are changing, for the better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How were you able to balance work and pregnancy? What was the greatest challenge?</b></p>
<p>It was a really good time in my career for me to be pregnant. I was shooting features, but they were low-budget indie features. The hardest shoot was probably a feature called <i>Little Birds</i>,which I shot when I was seven to eight months pregnant. It was a difficult challenge; we did 16-hour days because we only had 19 days to shoot the movie. It worked out because my being pregnant helped inspire the crew. When you love what you do, the adrenaline keeps you going.</p>
<p>With that job, I noticed an interesting thing in that the only person who worried about me shooting while pregnant was another woman. She was like, “Well, I’m a little worried, maybe we should get you an operator.” I get that she was trying to be helpful, but she was the only person who was thinking I couldn’t do it. It’s interesting that sometimes the judgment can come from within our own gender. But it was refreshing having the men on the project not question my ability to perform my job.</p>

<p><b>What were some of your seminal filmmaking experiences while at NYU?</b></p>
<p>I learned a lot while I was ACing for this other DP named Frederick Menou. That was a valuable experience in terms of accumulating knowledge about cinematography because he would teach me about lighting as he did it. At NYU, I recognized I loved what I was doing and in order to be successful at it I had to take risks and put myself out there as a DP even if I didn’t always feel confident in my own skills as a beginner. Through doing and making my own mistakes as a DP for others, I learned. After graduating, it got a lot harder because I had to seek out the work in the real world while supporting myself in other ways. I realized very quickly that the only people who succeed in this line of work are the people who persevere, even when it gets tough to pay your rent and find what you’re looking for creatively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What do you look for in scripts that you have the opportunity to shoot?</b></p>
<p>One of the main things I’m immediately turned off by is too much dialogue and a story that has no faith in the intelligence of its audience by being overly expository. Less is nearly always more in storytelling. There’s a William S. Burroughs quote I always try to remember when I’m working…“Start thinking in images, without words.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What films or experiences are you proudest of?</b></p>
<p>Right now, the movie I’m most proud of is <i>Meadowland</i> because I not only DP’d and directed it, but because it feels the most like “me.” I’ve never taken so many risks as a filmmaker and I’m so happy I did. Another project I&#8217;m very proud of is <i>Kill Your Darlings </i>because it was so ambitious, a huge challenge. We had nine movie stars, only 24 days of shooting, and were recreating the year 1943, on a limited budget, so it was a really tough shoot. But it was one of those shoots where everyone bonded because we loved the story so much, even though it was roller coaster ride of a shoot. I’m [also] so proud of <i>Looking</i>, the HBO series I did the first season of, because of what it meant to the gay community. It was really special to get to be a part of that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2015/02/fusions-woman-year-reed-morano-talks-industrys-gender-issue-shooting-pregnant-proudest-works/storyboard_kill_your_darlings_-11-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-2984"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2984 aligncenter" alt="Storyboard_Kill_Your_Darlings_ 11-1" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Storyboard_Kill_Your_Darlings_-11-1-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><b>What makes a successful collaborator?</b></p>
<p>Being a good listener. I joke around sometimes and say that the DP is like a shrink for the director, but there’s some truth in there. I strive to be completely there for my directors so they can totally trust me and rely on me. It’s my duty to make everybody feel secure, from producers to directors to actors. Especially the actors &#8211; if I don’t make the actors feel as comfortable as possible in front of the camera, it’s possible they’re not going to be able to give their best performance. As a DP, I’ve found that my most invaluable skills besides lighting and using my eye are problem solving, diplomacy and being a great communicator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What advice would you give aspiring, particularly female, filmmakers?</b></p>
<p>I would say don’t get hung up on the female thing. The art is not about that.  I’m tired of hearing, “It’s so hard being a female filmmaker. Look at the percentages.” Honestly, if anything, I had an edge as a female because it set me apart from everyone else. What I would rather see happen would be more women thinking, “What is a story that hasn’t been told before?” and using our unique minds to find new perspectives.  Keep your focus. If you really want to do it, don’t let anything hold you back and you will.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><em>by Daniella Duarte, Editorial Staff Writer</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/?attachment_id=2727" rel="attachment wp-att-2727"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2727 aligncenter" alt="reed2" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/reed2-300x148.jpg" width="300" height="148" /></a></em>This year, we are honoring cinematographer and director Reed Morano as our Woman of the Year for her astonishing body of work, as well as her induction into the legendary cinematographer’s guild, The American Society of Cinematographers. Reed is one of only 14 women of the approximately 350 active members in the organization, and is also youngest member to ever be admitted. Her work includes <em>Little Birds</em>,<em> For Ellen</em>, <em>Kill Your Darlings</em>,<em> The Skeleton Twins</em>, and her upcoming directorial debut,<em> Meadowland</em>, which she also shot.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2728 aligncenter" alt="Storyboard_Kill_Your_Darlings_15" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Storyboard_Kill_Your_Darlings_15-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Among many of Reed’s accomplishments in film, she was honored with the 2011 Kodak Vision Award for cinematography at the Women in Film Crystal + Lucy awards, and in past years has been named one of Variety&#8217;s &#8220;10 Cinematographers to Watch,&#8221; one of Ioncinema.com&#8217;s “American New Wave 25,&#8221; and one of five innovative cinematographers in ICG Magazine&#8217;s “Generation Next&#8221; spotlight. In 2012, Reed&#8217;s work was featured in Indiewire&#8217;s “On the Rise &#8217;12: 5 Cinematographers Lighting Up Screens in Recent Years&#8221; and was named an Indiewire “Heroine of Cinema” twice in 2 years. Some of Reed&#8217;s thoughts on the digital revolution and how it has affected filmmaking are featured in Keanu Reeves&#8217; acclaimed documentary Side by Side. She also earned the honor to be featured in Kodak&#8217;s long-running OnFilm series.</p>
<div id="attachment_2732" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2732 " alt="frozen_river-207720" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/frozen_river-207720-300x240.jpg" width="300" height="240" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Still  from &#8220;Frozen River&#8221;</p></div>
<div id="attachment_2733" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2733 " alt="still-of-paul-dano-in-for-ellen-(2012)-large-picture" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/still-of-paul-dano-in-for-ellen-2012-large-picture-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Still from &#8220;For Ellen&#8221;</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">Equally impressive, Reed has become a mainstay of the Sundance Film Festival; <em>Frozen River</em> won the Grand Jury prize at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and went on to be nominated for two Academy Awards (Best Actress for Melissa Leo and Best Screenplay) and seven Independent Spirit Awards, including Best Picture. The film received critical acclaim with film critic Hiram Lee mentioning “The necessary attention has been paid to seemingly small but ultimately meaningful details, and the camera of Hunt and cinematographer Reed Morano lingers just long enough on the right things—a face, the interactions between two children—to allow us time to think about what&#8217;s playing out before our eyes.” Audiences in Park City have also seen the premieres of <em>Little Birds</em>, which competed at the 2011 festival, <em>Shut Up and Play the Hits</em>, a feature-length documentary about the band LCD Soundsystem that premiered at the 2012 festival, and<em> For Ellen</em>, which also debuted at the 2012 festival in the dramatic competition.</p>
<div id="attachment_2731" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2731 " alt="THE SKELETON TWINS, from left: Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, 2014. ©Lionsgate/Courtesy Everett" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/720x405-MCDSKTW-EC003_H-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Still from &#8220;The Skeleton Twins&#8221;</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">In 2014, audiences were treated to two more of her projects—the hugely successful <em>The Skeleton Twins</em>, a black comedy starring Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader, directed by Craig Johnson and co-written by Mark Heyman (<em>Black Swan</em>), and <em>War Story</em>, a dark drama filmed in Sicily starring Catherine Keener and Sir Ben Kingsley, directed by Mark Jackson (<em>Without</em>). Both of these films premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2014. Also released this year were the cult 35mm and 65mm dark drama <em>Autumn Blood</em>, shot in the Tyrolean Alps in Austria, starring Sophie Lowe and Peter Stormare, and Rob Reiner&#8217;s latest feature, <em>And So It Goes</em>, starring Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton (her second collaboration with Reiner). In January of 2014, HBO premiered the first season of its new original series, <em>Looking</em>, shot masterfully by Reed and directed by Andrew Haigh (<em>Weekend</em>).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2735 aligncenter" alt="RMWalkerFeature" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RMWalkerFeature-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">More recently, Reed began production on her first feature as both director and DP (not to mention editor); the dark drama <em>Meadowland</em> features a murderer’s row of talent from Olivia Wilde and Luke Wilson to Giovanni Ribisi and Elisabeth Moss. Moreover, Reed is generously leading the charge on a movement to control motion interpolation AKA &#8220;the soap opera effect&#8221; on our HDTVs. Reed&#8217;s <a href="http://change.org/">change.org</a> petition is supported by 10,500 signatures and has gained significant momentum, attracting the attention of both the film and technology communities. The petition reflects her passion for the industry, and the value of her work and the work of other DPs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2737 aligncenter" alt="MV5BMjI0MTczOTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDAyMDM3MDE@._V1_SX640_SY720_" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMjI0MTczOTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDAyMDM3MDE@._V1_SX640_SY720_1-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Fusion greatly admires Reed for her talent, tenacity, and forward-thinking mentality. In a male-dominated industry, she’s more than proven her mettle and integrity, asserting, “I do not want to be treated special or differently because I’m a woman and I’m a DP. That’s what I’ve fought so hard for my entire career. I can do my job just as well as the next guy.” Further proving her commitment to the art, she even filmed <em>Little Birds</em> while seven months pregnant!  Fusion also looks up to Reed because of her familiar origins &#8211; she graduated from NYU’s Kanbar Institute in 2000 and accredits much of her young enthusiasm for cinematography to Professors Michael Carmine, David Irving and Rick Litvin. Following graduation, Reed paid it forward as an adjunct cinematography professor, co-instructing the first Advanced Television classes that NYU offered.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2730 aligncenter" alt="SPOTLIGHT REED MORANO INSERT001" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/SPOTLIGHT-REED-MORANO-INSERT001-300x219.jpg" width="300" height="219" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently, Reed lives in Brooklyn, New York with her husband and two children. Her reel can be found <a href="http://vimeo.com/57217479">here</a>. We thank Reed for her tremendous dedication to the art and for providing a hugely positive role model.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Congratulations to Fusion’s Woman of the Year, Reed Morano!</p>
