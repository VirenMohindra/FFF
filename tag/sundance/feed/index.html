				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><em>Alexander Hunter, Editorial Staff Writer</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Now playing is the theatrical release of Australian filmmaker Jennifer Kent’s first feature film, <em>The Babadook</em>. The film made a splash at this year’s Sundance and has received widespread critical acclaim, leading it to become one of the most talked-about horror films of the year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">”I’ve never seen a more terrifying film than THE BABADOOK” tweeted William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-10 at 12.29.18 PM.png" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t9kHawF4umsLN-hfTN_IxksHgcgpM1ElFS6EZjCsVG7PQMS1zzlkW-COZX90rIwljlLgU_we7C_R2x5lKB2h7kURC6hvn5oLKZTI-SUX5hgCafI997y3lHS574bUF5NG5Q" width="519px;" height="130px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Babadook</em> tells the story of Amelia and Robbie, single mother and son, as they encounter a mysterious children’s pop-up book about the Babadook: a dark, cloaked figure who wears a large, eerie smile on its illustrated face. “If it’s in a word, or it’s in a look, you can’t get rid of the Babadook.” Robbie, a boy of around six, is first to experience the creature’s existence outside of the book, screaming in terror as he experiences the creature’s daily hauntings. His mother presumes it to be a delusion only to realize his fear is anything but. <em>The Babadook</em> follows Amelia as she experiences the reality of her son’s fear within her own home.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/playing-jennifer-kents-the-babadook/the-babadook-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-2617"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2617" alt="the-babadook-4" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the-babadook-4-300x190.jpg" width="300" height="190" /></a></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">What appears to be an edge-of-your-seat horror film is actually a film about the relationship between a mother and her son, and the role a mother must rise to in order to protect her kin. While many horror films stereotypically feature cartoonish damsels in distress (does anyone remember the VH1 reality show Scream Queens? I do), <em>The Babadook</em> is a tale of female empowerment in the face of danger. The film turns an unfortunate trend of the genre upside down.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While we are all too aware of male dominance in the film industry, especially in the form of directors and protagonists, Kent is an exceedingly rare case. On top of general Hollywood trends, horror is an especially male-dominated genre. Kent states that she doesn’t believe the film to simply be a horror film, as she thinks of it through its central thematic lens: the mother/son relationship. The horror aspects are secondary. Let’s just say this unnerving film works on both levels.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Overall, this film represents something largely unseen in recent memory: a female-led horror film that deals with issues of empowerment, swimming upstream against modern genre trends. Kent’s film will hopefully carve the way for similar features in the future: quality independent horror, female presence onscreen, and confrontation of larger female issues like motherhood, responsibility, and fear. At Fusion we not only celebrate the presence of women in film, in front of and behind the camera, but also films that speak to feminine perspectives. <em>The Babadook</em> is a film that epitomizes Fusion’s mission, a film that we hope is the first of more to come. Check it out, but be warned: it’s pretty scary.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>The Babadook</em> is currently playing in limited release, screening at the IFC Center and the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York, for which I recently interviewed director Jennifer Kent (read here: <a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/daily/entry/the-babadook-director-jennifer-kent-discusses-her-nail-biting-directorial-d">http://www.filmlinc.com/daily/entry/the-babadook-director-jennifer-kent-discusses-her-nail-biting-directorial-d</a>)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though undeniable strides have been made in the last 50 years in the realm of women’s rights, the film and television industry has unfortunately lagged behind. The Fusion Film Festival has teamed up with other film festivals and institutions to remedy this lag. There were a total of 3,879 feature films submitted to the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Of those, a meager 16.9% listed female directors. Keri Putnam, the Executive Director of the Sundance Institute was quoted as saying “&#8230;What we’ve already found is that if statistics tell us a story, the story being told about women filmmakers today needs work.”</p>
<p>To combat this gender discrepancy, the Sundance Institute and Women in Film have partnered up in the hopes of promoting secure careers in the film field for women. The <a href="http://www.sundance.org/programs/women-filmmakers-initiative/">Women Filmmakers Initiative</a> was thus born.</p>
<p>In getting The Women Filmmakers Initiative on its feet, the Sundance Institute collaborated with USC Annenberg by jointly researching the prevalence of women in the film industry. The Initiative has aligned with many other innovative partners such as the AFI Conservatory, Athena Film Festival, Paley Center for Media, PGA, and Women Make Movies among others. The chief aim for The Women Filmmakers Initiative in garnering information was to determine just what the first areas of concern to be addressed should be. In the end, four main goals for the 2012 year were stated as primary areas of focus: Mentorship, Finance Education, Training, and Access and Raising Awareness, and Facilitating Collaboration.</p>
<p>Women in Film and the Sundance Initiative hosted a one-day Forum on November 12, 2013 to provide female writers, directors, and producers in the film industry with current film financing models, information on what investors are seeking, and information on examples of properly financed films. The conference also provided information about how to have more confidence necessary when fundraising for a film project. Fusion’s Allied Partner status to the Initiative granted Fusion the opportunity to send a filmmaker/fellow to attend the Forum. Tisch UGFTV alum Misha Green attended in this position. Additionally Lauren Ciaravalli, a previous Fusion co-director, attended the Forum in the role of spokesperson and spoke about Fusion’s history at the Paley Center for New Media in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>As a part of The Women Filmmakers Initiative, various schools of status within the entertainment realms have been named Allied Partners of this initiative. As NYU’s very own Fusion Film Festival continues to grow, it has had the honor of being named an Allied Partner as another step towards gender equality in the film industry. Putnam has been quoted saying, “Sundance Institute has long believed in the value of diverse storytellers contributing to a vibrant culture.” Undoubtedly, this Mentorship Program is just another step closer to achieving the ultimate goal of diverse vibrancy in storytelling culture.</p>
