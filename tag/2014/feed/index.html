				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Ben Eisen, Editorial Staff Head</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Female-Directed Show: <i>Olive Kitteridge</i></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/favorites-year/a_560x375/" rel="attachment wp-att-2630"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2630" alt="a_560x375" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/a_560x375-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>“It baffles me, this world. I don’t want to leave it yet.” So closes HBO’s incredible four-hour miniseries that proved more vital, moving, and human than anything else I saw this year. The cast is pitch perfect, the direction empathic in its pacing, and the writing reminiscent of such greats as <i>Mrs. Dalloway </i>and John Williams’ <i>Stoner</i>. Hats off to Frances McDormand and Lisa Chodolenko for powering something so special.</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions: Jenji Kohan’s immensely entertaining and humanistic second season of <i>Orange is the New Black</i>; the gleefully absurd <i>Broad City</i>; Jill Soloway’s brutally honest family portrait in <i>Transparent</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Female Performance: Elisabeth Moss, <i>Listen Up Philip</i></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/favorites-year/a15325/" rel="attachment wp-att-2631"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2631" alt="a15325" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/a15325-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>By turns heartbreaking and strong-willed as the titular narcissist’s ex, Ashley Kane, Moss leaves no doubt she’ll keep rocking it post-<i>Mad Men</i>. Although Jason Schartzman kills it in the role he was born to play, Moss commands the screen with an even more memorable and dynamic turn, charting the emotionally taxing aftermath of a breakup. Watching her struggle to smile through tears after Philip comes and goes at will is a master class in acting.</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions: Frances McDormand’s bracingly funny and real Olive Kitteridge; Amy Landecker’s stressed out parent in <i>Louie’</i>s achingly melancholy “In The Woods”; Gaby Hoffmann’s rootless Pfefferman daughter in <i>Transparent </i>(think a more endearing and empathic Hannah Horvath).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Female-Directed Movie: <i>The Babadook</i></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/favorites-year/bab3865-edit-640x356/" rel="attachment wp-att-2632"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2632" alt="BAB3865-Edit-640x356" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/BAB3865-Edit-640x356-300x166.jpg" width="300" height="166" /></a></p>
<p>Horror and emotional honesty don’t usually go hand in hand, but director Jennifer Kent subverts convention in her deeply felt debut film. From Essie’s Davis potent performance as a conflicted mother to the consummate and tense cinematography, everything about the movie feels assured and controlled at a level most filmmakers never reach. Here’s to a long career for Kent.</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions: I haven’t been to the theater enough this year, so still need to see my sister’s favorite, <i>Obvious Child</i>, the promising and unfortunately topical <i>Selma</i>, and the Jarmuschian <i>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</i>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><em>Alexander Hunter, Editorial Staff Writer</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Now playing is the theatrical release of Australian filmmaker Jennifer Kent’s first feature film, <em>The Babadook</em>. The film made a splash at this year’s Sundance and has received widespread critical acclaim, leading it to become one of the most talked-about horror films of the year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">”I’ve never seen a more terrifying film than THE BABADOOK” tweeted William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-10 at 12.29.18 PM.png" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t9kHawF4umsLN-hfTN_IxksHgcgpM1ElFS6EZjCsVG7PQMS1zzlkW-COZX90rIwljlLgU_we7C_R2x5lKB2h7kURC6hvn5oLKZTI-SUX5hgCafI997y3lHS574bUF5NG5Q" width="519px;" height="130px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Babadook</em> tells the story of Amelia and Robbie, single mother and son, as they encounter a mysterious children’s pop-up book about the Babadook: a dark, cloaked figure who wears a large, eerie smile on its illustrated face. “If it’s in a word, or it’s in a look, you can’t get rid of the Babadook.” Robbie, a boy of around six, is first to experience the creature’s existence outside of the book, screaming in terror as he experiences the creature’s daily hauntings. His mother presumes it to be a delusion only to realize his fear is anything but. <em>The Babadook</em> follows Amelia as she experiences the reality of her son’s fear within her own home.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/playing-jennifer-kents-the-babadook/the-babadook-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-2617"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2617" alt="the-babadook-4" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/the-babadook-4-300x190.jpg" width="300" height="190" /></a></em></p>
<p dir="ltr">What appears to be an edge-of-your-seat horror film is actually a film about the relationship between a mother and her son, and the role a mother must rise to in order to protect her kin. While many horror films stereotypically feature cartoonish damsels in distress (does anyone remember the VH1 reality show Scream Queens? I do), <em>The Babadook</em> is a tale of female empowerment in the face of danger. The film turns an unfortunate trend of the genre upside down.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While we are all too aware of male dominance in the film industry, especially in the form of directors and protagonists, Kent is an exceedingly rare case. On top of general Hollywood trends, horror is an especially male-dominated genre. Kent states that she doesn’t believe the film to simply be a horror film, as she thinks of it through its central thematic lens: the mother/son relationship. The horror aspects are secondary. Let’s just say this unnerving film works on both levels.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Overall, this film represents something largely unseen in recent memory: a female-led horror film that deals with issues of empowerment, swimming upstream against modern genre trends. Kent’s film will hopefully carve the way for similar features in the future: quality independent horror, female presence onscreen, and confrontation of larger female issues like motherhood, responsibility, and fear. At Fusion we not only celebrate the presence of women in film, in front of and behind the camera, but also films that speak to feminine perspectives. <em>The Babadook</em> is a film that epitomizes Fusion’s mission, a film that we hope is the first of more to come. Check it out, but be warned: it’s pretty scary.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>The Babadook</em> is currently playing in limited release, screening at the IFC Center and the Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York, for which I recently interviewed director Jennifer Kent (read here: <a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/daily/entry/the-babadook-director-jennifer-kent-discusses-her-nail-biting-directorial-d">http://www.filmlinc.com/daily/entry/the-babadook-director-jennifer-kent-discusses-her-nail-biting-directorial-d</a>)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now entering its eleventh year, the Fusion had its first full team meeting on October 21<sup>st</sup> to kick off the 2013-2014 year. The room was packed with returning members as well as an abundance of new members, all of which were greeted by co-directors Natalie Erazo, Darian Lanzetta, Nicole Quintero Ochoa, and Lucy Ross (who sent a video greeting from London, where she is studying this semester). The directors and department chairs were thrilled to meet with their respective committees and get started planning the festival, as well as events leading up to it. Among the subjects discussed were Fusion’s Coffee With series, roundtable discussions with women in the film and television industries. These events are open to NYU students who can submit an application in advance to reserve a seat.</p>
