				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>By Rachel Lambert, Editorial Staff Writer.</i></p>
<p>Female characters in fairytales, while set in environments of fiction and fantasy, have begun to express truer-to-life traits. They are expanding beyond a reliance on princes on handsome steeds and breaking gender stereotypes. <i>Once Upon a Time</i>, an ABC television series created by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, joins many characters, some new and some from well known fairytales and Disney films, in a creative plot set predominantly in Storybrooke, a fictional town in Maine. The storyline is intriguing, from its plot twists to its cleverly intermingled character relationships, and it provides a very empowering view of women through its multiple strong, female characters.</p>
<p>The main character is Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison), a woman who discovers that she is the daughter of Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), and that she is the “savior” who can break the curse over Storybrooke. Emma exhibits remarkable fortitude, intelligence, and independence, and despite the obstacles that stand before her, continues to persevere and protect the town and her family. She is not perfect; for instance, she made mistakes when she was younger when trying to cope with being an orphan, but this again reveals the fine line between fantasy and reality. Magic comes with a price, and so do our decisions. The characters, like us, are multi-faceted and subject to the challenging situations life propels at them. Their perseverance through these situations, willingness to learn from their mistakes, and readiness to be the rescuers rather than the rescued is what makes them so motivational and relatable.</p>
<p>The show’s central antagonist, as much as the protagonist, breaks stereotypes as well. We are all familiar with the “evil stepmother” concept, but <i>Once Upon A Time’s</i> Regina Mills (Lana Parrilla), the queen who released the curse over Storybrooke, reveals that villains too are complex. They become evil not by an inherent desire to cause suffering, or by a devotion to vanity (as it is commonly portrayed), but by struggling to cope with their personal tragedies. Regina actually saved Snow White’s life when she was a child; however, Snow’s failure to keep a secret about Regina’s lover, a divulgence that led to his murder, was part of what sparked Regina’s villainy. In the series, Snow White and the Evil Queen are more than symbols of either virtue or vanity; instead, they are both human.</p>
<p>The same is true for other characters. Belle (Emilie de Ravin) exercises empathy and curiosity but sometimes lacks self-confidence. Red Riding Hood (Meghan Ory), who transforms into the Wolf, is tough but must also battle her inner beast, and her granny (Beverley Elliott), sharp-tongued and crossbow-bearing, is far from defenseless. The series has featured many other women as well, from Ariel (JoAnna Garcia Swisher) to the Wicked Witch of the West (Rebecca Mader), Tinker Bell (Rose McIver), Elsa (Georgina Haig) and Anna (Elizabeth Lail) of Arendelle, and more. Each woman has a goal that defines them and a past that built their identities. Some make more admirable decisions than others, but they all show that women are far from delicate damsels.</p>
<p>The characters in <i>Once Upon a Time</i> are independent, but that does not mean they reject love. Yes, the idea of “love at first sight” is challenged, but the characters still have lovers, families, and friends that they fight to protect. The relationships between characters grow over time, as love often does in the real world, evidencing a shift towards a more authentic perspective on romance. The performances by the many brilliant actresses in the cast are fantastic. Viewers empathize with the characters, want to see them find their happily ever afters, and join in every episode’s adventure.</p>
<p><i>Once Upon a Time</i> fuses imagination with reality. Physical magic exists in the show, but it symbolizes and makes visual the magic we all possess. Some of the characters are afraid of their powers in a way that is similar to how many of us suppress what makes us unique, but they move past this fear. It is inspiring to see characters like Emma Swan, savior, mother, and sheriff, who reveals how tough, inventive, and brave women are. Women can sword fight, care for children, battle dragons, and save towns. They can be nurturers and protectors, fighters and peacekeepers. All stereotypes can be shattered, and everyone can be a hero.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Ben Eisen, Editorial Staff Head</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Female-Directed Show: <i>Olive Kitteridge</i></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/favorites-year/a_560x375/" rel="attachment wp-att-2630"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2630" alt="a_560x375" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/a_560x375-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>“It baffles me, this world. I don’t want to leave it yet.” So closes HBO’s incredible four-hour miniseries that proved more vital, moving, and human than anything else I saw this year. The cast is pitch perfect, the direction empathic in its pacing, and the writing reminiscent of such greats as <i>Mrs. Dalloway </i>and John Williams’ <i>Stoner</i>. Hats off to Frances McDormand and Lisa Chodolenko for powering something so special.</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions: Jenji Kohan’s immensely entertaining and humanistic second season of <i>Orange is the New Black</i>; the gleefully absurd <i>Broad City</i>; Jill Soloway’s brutally honest family portrait in <i>Transparent</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Female Performance: Elisabeth Moss, <i>Listen Up Philip</i></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/favorites-year/a15325/" rel="attachment wp-att-2631"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2631" alt="a15325" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/a15325-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>By turns heartbreaking and strong-willed as the titular narcissist’s ex, Ashley Kane, Moss leaves no doubt she’ll keep rocking it post-<i>Mad Men</i>. Although Jason Schartzman kills it in the role he was born to play, Moss commands the screen with an even more memorable and dynamic turn, charting the emotionally taxing aftermath of a breakup. Watching her struggle to smile through tears after Philip comes and goes at will is a master class in acting.</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions: Frances McDormand’s bracingly funny and real Olive Kitteridge; Amy Landecker’s stressed out parent in <i>Louie’</i>s achingly melancholy “In The Woods”; Gaby Hoffmann’s rootless Pfefferman daughter in <i>Transparent </i>(think a more endearing and empathic Hannah Horvath).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Female-Directed Movie: <i>The Babadook</i></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/favorites-year/bab3865-edit-640x356/" rel="attachment wp-att-2632"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2632" alt="BAB3865-Edit-640x356" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/BAB3865-Edit-640x356-300x166.jpg" width="300" height="166" /></a></p>
<p>Horror and emotional honesty don’t usually go hand in hand, but director Jennifer Kent subverts convention in her deeply felt debut film. From Essie’s Davis potent performance as a conflicted mother to the consummate and tense cinematography, everything about the movie feels assured and controlled at a level most filmmakers never reach. Here’s to a long career for Kent.</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions: I haven’t been to the theater enough this year, so still need to see my sister’s favorite, <i>Obvious Child</i>, the promising and unfortunately topical <i>Selma</i>, and the Jarmuschian <i>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</i>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Kevin Park, Editorial Staff Writer</em></p>
<p>Since both Disney/Marvel and Warner Brothers revealed their massive slate of superhero films that will last them until 2019, the demand for a female-driven superhero movie has only gotten louder. Currently Warner Bros. is planning to introduce Wonder Woman (played by Gal Gadot) in 2016&#8242;s <i>Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice</i>, which will be followed up by a standalone film now rumored to be directed by Michelle MacLaren (<i>Breaking Bad</i>, <i>The Walking Dead</i>). In response, Marvel is planning to release <i>Captain Marvel</i> in 2018, a movie that will focus on the titular character Carol Danvers. There are also talks of creating a Black Widow spinoff film and a female centric Spiderman spinoff project from Sony as well.</p>
<p>I think that with these recent developments, there is a great opportunity here for more female directors to break into Hollywood, especially those coming from an indie background. They have the potential to add a fresh perspective to a genre already showing signs of fatigue and wear. Much like how Jennifer Lee&#8217;s <i>Frozen</i> was lauded for bringing stronger female centered themes to the classic Disney Princess movies, I believe that the right director can achieve similar results in the upcoming films from Marvel, DC, and Sony. Here is my wish list of women I would like to see behind the camera for a superhero movie:</p>
<p>- Jennifer Kent (<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szaLnKNWC-U">The Babadook</a></em>) &#8211; Scott Derrickson (<i>Sinister</i>, <i>Deliver Us from Evil</i>) is currently slated to direct Marvel&#8217;s <i>Doctor Strange, </i>but Jenifer Kent is in my opinion a more promising choice. Her first feature, <i>The Babadook</i>, has received critical acclaim and was praised for balancing genuine horror with a strong thoughtful story. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szaLnKNWC-U"><br />
</a></p>
<p>- Patty Jenkins (<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq70brIQP40">Monster</a></em>) &#8211; More involved in television than film now, her direction for <i>The Killing</i> earned her positive reviews. At one point in talks to direct Marvel&#8217;s <i>Thor: The Dark World</i>, her gritty sensibilities make her more appropriate to the world of DC.</p>
<p>- Andrea Arnold (<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiAWrSB-yHA">Fish Tank</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUWOCd894-Q">Wuthering Heights</a></em>) &#8211; Known for her intimate kitchen sink dramas such as <i>Fish Tank</i>, Arnold has an uncompromising style that would be very interesting to see in a superhero movie, where playing it safe seems to be the unquestioned rule of the game.</p>
<p>- Kathryn Bigelow (<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl_cFzTjI10">The Hurt Locker</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yY0JP8lAlo">Zero Dark Thirty</a></em>) &#8211; This would be glorious. Bigelow knows how to ratchet up tension better than almost everyone in Hollywood. In my opinion, she is a far more interesting choice to direct DC&#8217;s <i>The Suicide Squad</i> than current choice David Ayer (<i>End of Watch</i>, <i>Fury</i>).</p>
<p>- Brenda Chapman (<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtrDBQ_qmlg">Brave</a></em>) &#8211; Chapman can pull a Brad Bird here, who went from Pixar&#8217;s <i>The Incredibles</i> and <i>Ratatouille</i> to the live action <i>Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol</i>. Chapman has a powerfully developed visual sense that aided her work in <i>The Prince of Egypt</i> and <i>Brave</i>, so it seems natural to think that her vision can do wonders for the superhero world.</p>
