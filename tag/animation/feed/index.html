<p>Shelley Page is an awe-­inspiring woman with an extraordinary career in the animation industry. She was one of the original Dreamworks Animation team members and is now Dreamworks&#8217; Head of International Outreach. In addition to working in the field herself, she reaches out to young artists in search of new talent and storytellers for the future. After giving a presentation at NYU Tisch, she spoke with us about her career and her advice to aspiring animators.</p>
<p><em><strong>What drew you to animation?</strong></em></p>
<p>Actually I got into animation completely by accident. I started off as an illustrator, but I was very lucky to be offered a job doing some graphic design for a project that was directed by one of the great legends of animation, Richard Williams. After I worked for him for a little while as a graphic designer, he offered me a job.</p>
<p>As an illustrator I had spent many years doing things like children’s book illustration, packaging illustration, [and] costume design for theatre. But it was only when I started working for Richard Williams, and I saw my artwork begin to move, that I got addicted to the idea that illustration could be something more than a two-­dimensional thing. It could be a storytelling device in three­-dimension.</p>
<p><em><strong>What have been some of your favorite projects that you’ve worked on?</strong></em></p>
<p>There are many, many things that have been very special to me, for different reasons. I have to say, of all the Dreamworks projects, <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> was the special one for me. But from a career point of view, it was probably <em>Shrek</em> ​because I was part of the original development team, and it was such an amazing experience being surrounded by this extraordinary group of artists, developing something that became like a household property years later.</p>
<p><em><strong>How did you become involved with Dreamworks Animation?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, I would love to say it was a deliberate career choice, but in fact, when I was working for Richard Williams, he was already being approached by the Walt Disney Company to set up a studio to make <em>W​ho Framed Roger Rabbit?</em>,​ so we sort of became part of the Disney studio even though we were based in London. When <em>R​oger Rabbit</em> ​concluded and the studio wound down, Steven Spielberg ­ who was the executive producer ­decided to keep the team together. He set up his Amblimation studio and I was asked to become head of backgrounds there, but after making two or three films at the London-­based Amblimation, it was difficult for Steven to work so far away from his team. Some things fell into place, a new animation studio was created in L.A, and ​t​he core team from London was actually invited to come over and become Dreamworks Animation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div title="Page 2">
<p><em><strong>You are now the Head of International Outreach at Dreamworks. How did you obtain this position, and what do you enjoy most about it?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well it’s a similar story in a way because the role didn’t exist until I took it on. We had recruiters who went out into the field looking for particular artists, but we didn’t really have anybody who was engaging with the schools and universities. So, some years back, we set up the Outreach department at Dreamworks. But by this time I had moved back to London and thus was given the task of being involved with the international schools, universities, film festivals, [and] some studios. I became the international eye of [Dreamworks] out there. So the job essentially joined me; I didn’t really join the position. After a while, it’s become a more formalized role where I’m really the point person for first contact with all universities that we hope to recruit new talent from in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>You also created the “Eye Candy Show.” What inspired its creation?</strong></em></p>
<p>It was sort of accidental because in the early days when I was bringing exciting new work back from my travels in Europe and around the world, I had to bring it into the studio in my handbag. Literally my nickname was the “Mary Poppins of Animation” because I would always come in and say, “Oh, I’ve got this wonderful film. It’s just in my handbag. Let me show you.” And it was always on pneumatic tapes or VHS tapes (this is before DVDs).​ A​fter a while I thought, “This is just too time­-consuming,” so I compiled all the new work I had seen into one screening which I showed at Dreamworks, which ​b​ecame known as the “Shelley Show.” Lots and lots of people came to see that and were inspired by the work I showed. Gradually some international festivals got to hear about this screening, which I didn’t really think was unique, but it turns out there really aren’t many people doing something similar. I’ve given “Eye Candy” presentations at pretty much every major festival you can imagine in pretty much every country you can imagine. It’s sort of my traveling handbag full of new stuff.</p>
<p><em><strong>What is the most important life lesson you have learned from your work and experiences?</strong></em></p>
<p>Definitely the most important life lesson is to be open to all opportunities because if I had at any point in my professional career said &#8220;no&#8221; to something ­- because it was either too big a challenge or it was relocating or it was so much time for not much money &#8211; ­ if I had said “no” to any of those things I definitely wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing today. But because I’m curious and like to challenge myself and am endlessly fascinated with what other people are doing, I was able to develop a career for myself that didn’t exist before. The life lesson is to accept the challenges that come your way and don’t hesitate. Even if you’re intimidated by something or you think it’s beyond your capabilities, you never know till you try, and I’ve always taken the role of having a go.</p>
</div>
<div title="Page 3">
<p><em><strong>You have so many remarkable achievements. What do you look forward to achieving in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>I used to joke that if they ever discover life on Mars, I’ll be on the next spaceship saying, “Have you got any good animation schools out here?” I’m sure that Russia is on my horizon because I’ve already been to the Putin Mito out there, and I’m really looking forward to getting involved with the animation scene in Russia. On a personal level, I’m watching my son who’s a creative writing major now in his final year at college. It’s interesting seeing it from the parent’s side of view for a change instead of that of the student or the professional. I’m curious to see where that will take him.</p>
<p>And I think for Dreamworks, the idea of building this enormous new facility in Shanghai is just such a fascinating opportunity. I’ve made many great friends out there, and I’m so looking forward to seeing it grow into this huge enterprise. It’ll be a place where anybody visiting Shanghai who is interested in entertainment will come to. It’s a whole new world, literally.</p>
<p><em><strong>What advice would you give to those aspiring to work in the animation field?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think when I interview people who are interested in joining this profession, I’m always looking for two things. One is obviously that special skill set because you kind of know it when you see it. It’s someone who has that extra added sparkle. There’s always those people that stand out. And for those people, my advice is to be brave, and don’t just take the first job that comes your way that might get you a foot on the ladder or earn you a living. Take the one that’s really going to push you to do things that maybe you didn’t think you were capable of because that’s how you will really know what your potential is. Don’t underplay your abilities, but also focus on where your real strengths lie, and then go for it. The sky’s the limit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Corrine Stein, Editorial Staff Writer </em></p>
<p>Since the birth of animation, it has been agreed that one of the medium’s greatest strengths is the freedom it gives filmmakers to set their stories from any perspective imaginable, and in any world they have the creativity to dream up. Looking at the filmography of just one of America’s most prominent animation studios, Pixar, you can find films featuring characters as diverse as a neurotic clownfish who wants to find his son, a blue monster who befriends a toddler, and a rat that rises to prominence in the world of haute cuisine.  However, as much as we love these characters and the inventiveness with which their tales are told, we can’t help but notice that there’s a certain type of diversity lacking from them that hits a little closer to home.</p>
<p>On November 3<sup>rd</sup>, Caroline Siede of the AV Club published an article titled “10 of 14 Pixar Films Fail the Bechdel Test,” which presents a well-formed gateway for a conversation about the responsibility a studio with such influence to better represent women in their films.  To review, a film that passes the Bechdel test includes:</p>
<p>. Two named female characters</p>
<p>.Who engage in a conversation</p>
<p>.About something other than a man.</p>
<p>True to the title of Siede’s article, only four Pixar films live up to that relatively low bar of representation: <i>The Incredibles, Brave, Toy Story 3, </i>and<i> A Bug’s Life</i>. Now, the Bechdel test is often criticized for being too general to focus on nuanced criteria, and it’s also true that Pixar’s films have introduced us to a number of quality female characters over the years. No discussion of Pixar’s best is complete without a reference to Dory, the forgetful fish from <i>Finding Nemo</i> who turned out to be such a fan-favorite that she’s slated to star in her own movie premiering in 2016, which will then be Pixar’s second female-led movie. Pixar’s first female-led film, <i>Brave</i>, also had the distinction of being the first of Pixar’s films to focus on a mother-daughter relationship, and the first where I really felt a natural equality in the amount of central female and male characters. On the surface, <i>Brave </i>seemed a step forward in female-inclusive storytelling, but the production of <i>Brave</i> tells a different tale, and serves as a window into the real problems that plague the animation industry. Despite its female-centric plot,<i> Brave</i> was written by Pixar’s usual male staff, and while it was originally to be directed by Brenda Chapman- the woman who had come up with the film’s original concept-Chapman was let go from the project over a year before its release over “creative differences.” Though the number of females onscreen in a movie may not be indicative of its overall diversity or progressiveness, it’s definitely a barometer for diversity where it matters most, which is behind the screen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/11/fresh-perspective-important-female-characters-animation/pixar-movie-theory/" rel="attachment wp-att-2559"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2559 aligncenter" alt="pixar-movie-theory" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/pixar-movie-theory-300x178.jpg" width="300" height="178" /></a></p>
<p>While Pixar has been taking small steps forward in recent years (<i>Brave, Finding Dory</i>)Pixar is going nowhere fast in its inclusion of diversity in creative positions, such as writing and directing. What Siede’s article does not get to touch on is the fact that 0 of Pixar’s 14 films were directed by women, and only two of them have been co-written by them (one of which is <i>Finding Dory</i>, which has yet to be released).  The inclusion of women in meaningful behind-the scenes roles makes all the difference in the characters and messages present in the work,  and that’s why we at Fusion believe what we do is so important. Filmmakers want to produce stories that they are passionate about, and our passions come from our experiences. Living as a woman is an experience no male director has ever had, and regardless of the subject matter, each female filmmaker adds a touch of her own perspective wherever she handles the material. When we settle for less diversity than is possible in our films, and go to the theater year after year to see movies written and directed by white, American men, we’re going to start sensing a degree of homogeny in the perspectives being presented, regardless of the skill of the storytellers. Though the stories of two monster roommates who collect screams and a rat who trains a hopeless chef to five-star skill have nothing in common on the surface, they are, on some level, nontraditional telling of a traditional story of male friendship, as are most of Pixar’s wonderful offerings. The formula has worked for Pixar in the past, but white, male perspective is limited.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/11/fresh-perspective-important-female-characters-animation/finding_dory_38938/" rel="attachment wp-att-2560"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2560 aligncenter" alt="Finding_Dory_38938" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Finding_Dory_38938-300x150.jpg" width="300" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>While I love Ratatouille, I have to agree with the film’s own Anton Ego when he calls for “<i>some fresh, clear, well-seasoned perspective</i>.”  I can’t help but wonder what it would be like to see an animated film about friendship, be it male/male, female/female, or something different altogether, being told by a woman. Good female representation onscreen will come from female power behind it, and when a woman has the opportunity to lend her experiences to a world, her influence will touch the story in a more meaningful way than a male filmmaker writing in a few more females for diversity’s sake. The same goes for the representation of any minority, whether racial, sexual or religious.</p>
<p>Now, since Pixar is just one part of the trifecta that I see controlling the American animation market, I took it upon myself to do some research into the track records the two other giants, Disney and Dreamworks, and the results were as follows: Disney animation’s first female director was Jennifer Lee on 2013’s <i>Frozen</i>, and the studio has featured female writers on their staff regularly since 1991’s <i>Beauty and the Beast. </i>Dreamworks has done better in the directorial department, with <i>Prince of Egypt, Shrek, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, Shark Tale </i>and<i> Kung Fu Panda 2</i> all being female-directed. However, not a single Dreamworks animated feature has had a female screenwriter. On one hand, both Disney and Dreamworks seem to be pointed in the correct direction for diversity, much moreso than Pixar. Notably, both Dreamworks and Disney have movies in production featuring a Black American and Polynesian girl as their respective main characters, both films are being produced by women, and Disney’s <i>Moana</i> boasts a writer who is a New Zealander of Polynesian descent. On the other hand, neither of the two have female writers or directors, nor is the amount of women in the records of all three studios anything too impressive. In 2014, I can think of only one major American animated film this year with a female in a major production role, which is Laika Studio’s <i>The Boxtrolls, </i>written in part by Irena Brignull.</p>
<p>In my first screenwriting class at NYU last spring, I learned fairly quickly what the real strengths of animated filmmaking are. When someone presented an idea and was told “you could animate this,” what their classmate meant was that their idea was so imaginative, so fantastic, that it would be hurt by the limitations of live-action budgets, sets or physics. This limitless facet of animation is also what makes it so enticing to children, who do not have to grapple with their pride when they profess their endorsement of a film about talking cars. The executives in the animation industry are used to going up against people who believe that the genre is lesser simply because children are often the most vocal consumers, and proud to flaunt their boundless imagination.  It’s disheartening to have to fight these same executives on the need for change, when we know that the target audience has already proved their acceptance of situations that are nowhere near as seated in reality as “a woman writes a relatable story.”  In a world where we’ve long accepted the influence of magic spells and talking animals, it’s time to accept the hand of women who have been waiting a century to lead us to our happy ever after.</p>
