<p>The Fusion Film Festival, NYU Tisch School of the Arts’ premiere student film festival showcasing the work of emerging female filmmakers throughout NYU, will name distinguished cinematographer Reed Morano as the Fusion “Woman of the Year” for 2015. The award presentation will be part of the Festival’s three days of screenings and panels celebrating women creators in film, TV, and New Media beginning Thursday, February 26 and running through Saturday, February 28. All events are free and open to the public.</p>
<p>The award ceremony will take place at the Cantor Film Center, 36 East 8th Street, New York on Saturday February 28 at 6:30 p.m, preceded by a retrospective of Morano’s work on the festival’s opening night. She will also conduct a Master Class as part of the Festival earlier in the day on Saturday.  Other winners of the “Woman of the Year” award have included Oscar-winning screenwriter Lucy Alibar and Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell, Dean Emerita of NYU Tisch.</p>
<p>“Reed Morano’s career is both an incredible inspiration and a clear rebuke to anyone who believes women cannot achieve stunning success behind the camera,” said co-director Lucy Ross.  “With over 40 credits under her belt at age 37, and her directorial debut <i>Meadowland in </i>upcoming release this year, Reed has maintained extraordinary quality, while achieving both commercial and artistic success as she maintains a full family life here in New York.  I can’t think of anybody else who is a better fit for Fusion’s Woman of the Year.”</p>
<p>The youngest member of the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC) and one of only 13 women in the 339-member organization, Morano has earned cinematography credits for 41 films and television programs, including <i>Frozen River</i>, starring Melissa Leo and directed by Courtney Hunt, which was nominated for two Academy Awards; <i>Skeleton Twins</i> (2014), starring Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig; and most recently <i>Meadowland</i>, starring Olivia Wilde and Giovanni Ribisi, which she also directed and is currently in post-production for. She won the 2011 Kodak Vision Award for Cinematography at the Women in Film Crystal + Lucy awards, and in past years has been named one of Variety&#8217;s &#8220;10 Cinematographers to Watch&#8221;, one of ioncinema.com&#8217;s &#8220;American New Wave 25&#8243;, and one of five innovative cinematographers in ICG magazine&#8217;s &#8220;Generation Next&#8221; spotlight.</p>
<p>In addition to film screenings throughout the three day festival, Fusion will also offer a variety of special events, including a showrunners panel featuring Amy Sherman-Palladino and Janet Tamaro; special panels on web series and women in horror cinema; screenings of award-winning features and shorts; and the presentation of the Canon Best Cinematographer &amp; Best of Fest awards and the Movado&#8217;s Emerging Artist Award.</p>
<p>“Now in its thirteenth year, NYU’s Fusion Film Festival has a growing reputation in the entertainment industry as a must-see showcase for up-and-coming filmmakers and cinematographers,” said Fusion co-director Natalie Erazo.”</p>
<p>“Iconic women from all areas of the entertainment industry bring their wisdom and energy to Fusion in a spirit that is unique to women supporting women,” said NYU Professor and Fusion’s Faculty Advisor Susan Sandler.</p>
<p>Below is a full list of programming and events. All events free and open to the public on a first come, first served basis. This year’s festival is sponsored by Canon Cameras, Adobe, Avid, Final Draft, Movado, and Essentia Water.
