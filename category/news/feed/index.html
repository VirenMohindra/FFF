				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Amanda Saiewitz and Ben Eisen, PR and Editorial Heads</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/?attachment_id=2742" rel="attachment wp-att-2742"><img class="size-full wp-image-2742 aligncenter" alt="reed morano" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/10635751_10203698295240406_3673849286736231745_n-e1422478197949.jpg" width="360" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>In many ways, 2014 was a great year for female filmmakers. Audiences adored Gillian Robespierre’s hilarious and progressive <i>Obvious Child</i>, Jennifer Kent’s terrifyingly visceral <i>The Babadook</i>, and Ava Duvernay’s authentic and complex <i>Selma</i>. Beyond these few names, however, women were again hugely underrepresented in the industry. According to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, only 7% of the 250 top grossing domestic films had a woman at the helm. That’s 7% for half the population.</p>
<p>Now in its thirteenth year, NYU Tisch School of the Arts’ Fusion Film Festival strives to alter this shocking disparity by celebrating women in film, television, and new media, from student to icon. While Fusion rewards female directors and DPs in its festival competitions, it also promotes gender collaboration amongst crews (i.e. female director, male DP) and the rich work such balance creates. The upcoming festival, February 26-28, will feature events with TV legends Amy Sherman-Palladino and Janet Tamaro, <i>American Psycho</i>’s Mary Harron in conversation with <i>Pet Sematary</i>’s Mary Lambert, and distinguished cinematographer Reed Morano, Fusion’s “Woman of the Year.”</p>
<p>Among on-the-rise DPs, few are as impressive or as downright tenacious as Morano. Following her breakout work on <i>Frozen River</i>, she’s repeatedly proved her mettle, shooting indie success <i>The Skeleton Twins</i>, vital music doc <i>Shut Up and Play the Hits</i>,and HBO’s critically acclaimed series <i>Looking</i>. Morano’s a technical master, a gifted storyteller, and a leading exemplar of Fusion’s mission. To mark the occasion, we spoke with Morano about the industry’s gender problem, the realities of shooting while pregnant, and her proudest works.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p><b>Since you’ve been in the industry, how have you seen crew/roles for women change? </b></p>
<p>When I was an undergraduate in Film &amp; TV at NYU/Tisch School of the Arts, many of the projects I shot had male directors, and only a few had female directors. It was generally a little more male-oriented than it is now. After graduating, I was shooting and working as a key grip and I often found myself the only female out of the whole crew, except for producers. Now, I see lots of women in a broader variety of roles.</p>
<p>There’s definitely a larger conversation about this going on. Some women wish that there were more equal opportunities in terms of hiring of DPs on studio movies because now there’s more equal opportunity going on for directors in that world. I just happen to disagree because I wouldn’t want to be hired that way. I would rather be hired for my talent. I also don’t want to shoot just any studio movie. Ideally, I want the most quality scripts I can find. That’s not something that equal opportunity is going to get you.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2015/02/fusions-woman-year-reed-morano-talks-industrys-gender-issue-shooting-pregnant-proudest-works/mv5bmji0mtczote4mv5bml5banbnxkftztgwmdaymdm3mde-1-_v1_sx640_sy720_/" rel="attachment wp-att-2986"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2986 aligncenter" alt="MV5BMjI0MTczOTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDAyMDM3MDE@-1._V1_SX640_SY720_" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MV5BMjI0MTczOTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDAyMDM3MDE@-1._V1_SX640_SY720_-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><b>What do you see for the future?</b></p>
<p>I see more and more female filmmakers. Look at Ava Duvernay’s Golden Globe nomination and her movie’s Oscar nom – that’s a huge deal and a big step in the right direction. You can’t expect everything to happen all at once when it’s been such a male-dominated world for so long. It’s 2015 and still no female has ever been nominated for Best Cinematography. It’s shocking, but I have to believe that’s because not enough females had been shooting up until recent years. I do think <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i> [shot by Ellen Kuras] should have been nominated and it still pisses me off that it wasn’t. I was recently at the ASC Open House in LA and I was approached by at least 15 up and coming female cinematographers. That, to me, is exactly what we need &#8211; to saturate the industry as women filmmakers &#8211; and it’s a sign that times and storytelling are changing, for the better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How were you able to balance work and pregnancy? What was the greatest challenge?</b></p>
<p>It was a really good time in my career for me to be pregnant. I was shooting features, but they were low-budget indie features. The hardest shoot was probably a feature called <i>Little Birds</i>,which I shot when I was seven to eight months pregnant. It was a difficult challenge; we did 16-hour days because we only had 19 days to shoot the movie. It worked out because my being pregnant helped inspire the crew. When you love what you do, the adrenaline keeps you going.</p>
<p>With that job, I noticed an interesting thing in that the only person who worried about me shooting while pregnant was another woman. She was like, “Well, I’m a little worried, maybe we should get you an operator.” I get that she was trying to be helpful, but she was the only person who was thinking I couldn’t do it. It’s interesting that sometimes the judgment can come from within our own gender. But it was refreshing having the men on the project not question my ability to perform my job.</p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2015/02/fusions-woman-year-reed-morano-talks-industrys-gender-issue-shooting-pregnant-proudest-works/unnamed-32/" rel="attachment wp-att-2983"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2983" alt="unnamed-32" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/unnamed-32-300x156.jpg" width="300" height="156" /></a></p>
<p><b>What were some of your seminal filmmaking experiences while at NYU?</b></p>
<p>I learned a lot while I was ACing for this other DP named Frederick Menou. That was a valuable experience in terms of accumulating knowledge about cinematography because he would teach me about lighting as he did it. At NYU, I recognized I loved what I was doing and in order to be successful at it I had to take risks and put myself out there as a DP even if I didn’t always feel confident in my own skills as a beginner. Through doing and making my own mistakes as a DP for others, I learned. After graduating, it got a lot harder because I had to seek out the work in the real world while supporting myself in other ways. I realized very quickly that the only people who succeed in this line of work are the people who persevere, even when it gets tough to pay your rent and find what you’re looking for creatively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What do you look for in scripts that you have the opportunity to shoot?</b></p>
<p>One of the main things I’m immediately turned off by is too much dialogue and a story that has no faith in the intelligence of its audience by being overly expository. Less is nearly always more in storytelling. There’s a William S. Burroughs quote I always try to remember when I’m working…“Start thinking in images, without words.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What films or experiences are you proudest of?</b></p>
<p>Right now, the movie I’m most proud of is <i>Meadowland</i> because I not only DP’d and directed it, but because it feels the most like “me.” I’ve never taken so many risks as a filmmaker and I’m so happy I did. Another project I&#8217;m very proud of is <i>Kill Your Darlings </i>because it was so ambitious, a huge challenge. We had nine movie stars, only 24 days of shooting, and were recreating the year 1943, on a limited budget, so it was a really tough shoot. But it was one of those shoots where everyone bonded because we loved the story so much, even though it was roller coaster ride of a shoot. I’m [also] so proud of <i>Looking</i>, the HBO series I did the first season of, because of what it meant to the gay community. It was really special to get to be a part of that.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2015/02/fusions-woman-year-reed-morano-talks-industrys-gender-issue-shooting-pregnant-proudest-works/storyboard_kill_your_darlings_-11-1/" rel="attachment wp-att-2984"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2984 aligncenter" alt="Storyboard_Kill_Your_Darlings_ 11-1" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Storyboard_Kill_Your_Darlings_-11-1-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><b>What makes a successful collaborator?</b></p>
<p>Being a good listener. I joke around sometimes and say that the DP is like a shrink for the director, but there’s some truth in there. I strive to be completely there for my directors so they can totally trust me and rely on me. It’s my duty to make everybody feel secure, from producers to directors to actors. Especially the actors &#8211; if I don’t make the actors feel as comfortable as possible in front of the camera, it’s possible they’re not going to be able to give their best performance. As a DP, I’ve found that my most invaluable skills besides lighting and using my eye are problem solving, diplomacy and being a great communicator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What advice would you give aspiring, particularly female, filmmakers?</b></p>
<p>I would say don’t get hung up on the female thing. The art is not about that.  I’m tired of hearing, “It’s so hard being a female filmmaker. Look at the percentages.” Honestly, if anything, I had an edge as a female because it set me apart from everyone else. What I would rather see happen would be more women thinking, “What is a story that hasn’t been told before?” and using our unique minds to find new perspectives.  Keep your focus. If you really want to do it, don’t let anything hold you back and you will.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><em>by Daniella Duarte, Editorial Staff Writer</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/?attachment_id=2727" rel="attachment wp-att-2727"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2727 aligncenter" alt="reed2" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/reed2-300x148.jpg" width="300" height="148" /></a></em>This year, we are honoring cinematographer and director Reed Morano as our Woman of the Year for her astonishing body of work, as well as her induction into the legendary cinematographer’s guild, The American Society of Cinematographers. Reed is one of only 14 women of the approximately 350 active members in the organization, and is also youngest member to ever be admitted. Her work includes <em>Little Birds</em>,<em> For Ellen</em>, <em>Kill Your Darlings</em>,<em> The Skeleton Twins</em>, and her upcoming directorial debut,<em> Meadowland</em>, which she also shot.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2728 aligncenter" alt="Storyboard_Kill_Your_Darlings_15" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Storyboard_Kill_Your_Darlings_15-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Among many of Reed’s accomplishments in film, she was honored with the 2011 Kodak Vision Award for cinematography at the Women in Film Crystal + Lucy awards, and in past years has been named one of Variety&#8217;s &#8220;10 Cinematographers to Watch,&#8221; one of Ioncinema.com&#8217;s “American New Wave 25,&#8221; and one of five innovative cinematographers in ICG Magazine&#8217;s “Generation Next&#8221; spotlight. In 2012, Reed&#8217;s work was featured in Indiewire&#8217;s “On the Rise &#8217;12: 5 Cinematographers Lighting Up Screens in Recent Years&#8221; and was named an Indiewire “Heroine of Cinema” twice in 2 years. Some of Reed&#8217;s thoughts on the digital revolution and how it has affected filmmaking are featured in Keanu Reeves&#8217; acclaimed documentary Side by Side. She also earned the honor to be featured in Kodak&#8217;s long-running OnFilm series.</p>
<div id="attachment_2732" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2732 " alt="frozen_river-207720" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/frozen_river-207720-300x240.jpg" width="300" height="240" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Still  from &#8220;Frozen River&#8221;</p></div>
<div id="attachment_2733" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2733 " alt="still-of-paul-dano-in-for-ellen-(2012)-large-picture" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/still-of-paul-dano-in-for-ellen-2012-large-picture-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Still from &#8220;For Ellen&#8221;</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">Equally impressive, Reed has become a mainstay of the Sundance Film Festival; <em>Frozen River</em> won the Grand Jury prize at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and went on to be nominated for two Academy Awards (Best Actress for Melissa Leo and Best Screenplay) and seven Independent Spirit Awards, including Best Picture. The film received critical acclaim with film critic Hiram Lee mentioning “The necessary attention has been paid to seemingly small but ultimately meaningful details, and the camera of Hunt and cinematographer Reed Morano lingers just long enough on the right things—a face, the interactions between two children—to allow us time to think about what&#8217;s playing out before our eyes.” Audiences in Park City have also seen the premieres of <em>Little Birds</em>, which competed at the 2011 festival, <em>Shut Up and Play the Hits</em>, a feature-length documentary about the band LCD Soundsystem that premiered at the 2012 festival, and<em> For Ellen</em>, which also debuted at the 2012 festival in the dramatic competition.</p>
<div id="attachment_2731" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2731 " alt="THE SKELETON TWINS, from left: Bill Hader, Kristen Wiig, 2014. ©Lionsgate/Courtesy Everett" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/720x405-MCDSKTW-EC003_H-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Still from &#8220;The Skeleton Twins&#8221;</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">In 2014, audiences were treated to two more of her projects—the hugely successful <em>The Skeleton Twins</em>, a black comedy starring Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader, directed by Craig Johnson and co-written by Mark Heyman (<em>Black Swan</em>), and <em>War Story</em>, a dark drama filmed in Sicily starring Catherine Keener and Sir Ben Kingsley, directed by Mark Jackson (<em>Without</em>). Both of these films premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2014. Also released this year were the cult 35mm and 65mm dark drama <em>Autumn Blood</em>, shot in the Tyrolean Alps in Austria, starring Sophie Lowe and Peter Stormare, and Rob Reiner&#8217;s latest feature, <em>And So It Goes</em>, starring Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton (her second collaboration with Reiner). In January of 2014, HBO premiered the first season of its new original series, <em>Looking</em>, shot masterfully by Reed and directed by Andrew Haigh (<em>Weekend</em>).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2735 aligncenter" alt="RMWalkerFeature" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/RMWalkerFeature-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">More recently, Reed began production on her first feature as both director and DP (not to mention editor); the dark drama <em>Meadowland</em> features a murderer’s row of talent from Olivia Wilde and Luke Wilson to Giovanni Ribisi and Elisabeth Moss. Moreover, Reed is generously leading the charge on a movement to control motion interpolation AKA &#8220;the soap opera effect&#8221; on our HDTVs. Reed&#8217;s <a href="http://change.org/">change.org</a> petition is supported by 10,500 signatures and has gained significant momentum, attracting the attention of both the film and technology communities. The petition reflects her passion for the industry, and the value of her work and the work of other DPs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2737 aligncenter" alt="MV5BMjI0MTczOTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDAyMDM3MDE@._V1_SX640_SY720_" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MV5BMjI0MTczOTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDAyMDM3MDE@._V1_SX640_SY720_1-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Fusion greatly admires Reed for her talent, tenacity, and forward-thinking mentality. In a male-dominated industry, she’s more than proven her mettle and integrity, asserting, “I do not want to be treated special or differently because I’m a woman and I’m a DP. That’s what I’ve fought so hard for my entire career. I can do my job just as well as the next guy.” Further proving her commitment to the art, she even filmed <em>Little Birds</em> while seven months pregnant!  Fusion also looks up to Reed because of her familiar origins &#8211; she graduated from NYU’s Kanbar Institute in 2000 and accredits much of her young enthusiasm for cinematography to Professors Michael Carmine, David Irving and Rick Litvin. Following graduation, Reed paid it forward as an adjunct cinematography professor, co-instructing the first Advanced Television classes that NYU offered.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2730 aligncenter" alt="SPOTLIGHT REED MORANO INSERT001" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/SPOTLIGHT-REED-MORANO-INSERT001-300x219.jpg" width="300" height="219" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently, Reed lives in Brooklyn, New York with her husband and two children. Her reel can be found <a href="http://vimeo.com/57217479">here</a>. We thank Reed for her tremendous dedication to the art and for providing a hugely positive role model.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Congratulations to Fusion’s Woman of the Year, Reed Morano!</p>

<p><strong>Favorite Female-Directed Show: <i>Olive Kitteridge</i></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/favorites-year/a_560x375/" rel="attachment wp-att-2630"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2630" alt="a_560x375" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/a_560x375-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>“It baffles me, this world. I don’t want to leave it yet.” So closes HBO’s incredible four-hour miniseries that proved more vital, moving, and human than anything else I saw this year. The cast is pitch perfect, the direction empathic in its pacing, and the writing reminiscent of such greats as <i>Mrs. Dalloway </i>and John Williams’ <i>Stoner</i>. Hats off to Frances McDormand and Lisa Chodolenko for powering something so special.</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions: Jenji Kohan’s immensely entertaining and humanistic second season of <i>Orange is the New Black</i>; the gleefully absurd <i>Broad City</i>; Jill Soloway’s brutally honest family portrait in <i>Transparent</i>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Female Performance: Elisabeth Moss, <i>Listen Up Philip</i></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/favorites-year/a15325/" rel="attachment wp-att-2631"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2631" alt="a15325" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/a15325-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a></p>
<p>By turns heartbreaking and strong-willed as the titular narcissist’s ex, Ashley Kane, Moss leaves no doubt she’ll keep rocking it post-<i>Mad Men</i>. Although Jason Schartzman kills it in the role he was born to play, Moss commands the screen with an even more memorable and dynamic turn, charting the emotionally taxing aftermath of a breakup. Watching her struggle to smile through tears after Philip comes and goes at will is a master class in acting.</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions: Frances McDormand’s bracingly funny and real Olive Kitteridge; Amy Landecker’s stressed out parent in <i>Louie’</i>s achingly melancholy “In The Woods”; Gaby Hoffmann’s rootless Pfefferman daughter in <i>Transparent </i>(think a more endearing and empathic Hannah Horvath).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Favorite Female-Directed Movie: <i>The Babadook</i></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/12/favorites-year/bab3865-edit-640x356/" rel="attachment wp-att-2632"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2632" alt="BAB3865-Edit-640x356" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/BAB3865-Edit-640x356-300x166.jpg" width="300" height="166" /></a></p>
<p>Horror and emotional honesty don’t usually go hand in hand, but director Jennifer Kent subverts convention in her deeply felt debut film. From Essie’s Davis potent performance as a conflicted mother to the consummate and tense cinematography, everything about the movie feels assured and controlled at a level most filmmakers never reach. Here’s to a long career for Kent.</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions: I haven’t been to the theater enough this year, so still need to see my sister’s favorite, <i>Obvious Child</i>, the promising and unfortunately topical <i>Selma</i>, and the Jarmuschian <i>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</i>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Corrine Stein, Editorial Staff Writer </em></p>
<p>Since the birth of animation, it has been agreed that one of the medium’s greatest strengths is the freedom it gives filmmakers to set their stories from any perspective imaginable, and in any world they have the creativity to dream up. Looking at the filmography of just one of America’s most prominent animation studios, Pixar, you can find films featuring characters as diverse as a neurotic clownfish who wants to find his son, a blue monster who befriends a toddler, and a rat that rises to prominence in the world of haute cuisine.  However, as much as we love these characters and the inventiveness with which their tales are told, we can’t help but notice that there’s a certain type of diversity lacking from them that hits a little closer to home.</p>
<p>On November 3<sup>rd</sup>, Caroline Siede of the AV Club published an article titled “10 of 14 Pixar Films Fail the Bechdel Test,” which presents a well-formed gateway for a conversation about the responsibility a studio with such influence to better represent women in their films.  To review, a film that passes the Bechdel test includes:</p>
<p>. Two named female characters</p>
<p>.Who engage in a conversation</p>
<p>.About something other than a man.</p>
<p>True to the title of Siede’s article, only four Pixar films live up to that relatively low bar of representation: <i>The Incredibles, Brave, Toy Story 3, </i>and<i> A Bug’s Life</i>. Now, the Bechdel test is often criticized for being too general to focus on nuanced criteria, and it’s also true that Pixar’s films have introduced us to a number of quality female characters over the years. No discussion of Pixar’s best is complete without a reference to Dory, the forgetful fish from <i>Finding Nemo</i> who turned out to be such a fan-favorite that she’s slated to star in her own movie premiering in 2016, which will then be Pixar’s second female-led movie. Pixar’s first female-led film, <i>Brave</i>, also had the distinction of being the first of Pixar’s films to focus on a mother-daughter relationship, and the first where I really felt a natural equality in the amount of central female and male characters. On the surface, <i>Brave </i>seemed a step forward in female-inclusive storytelling, but the production of <i>Brave</i> tells a different tale, and serves as a window into the real problems that plague the animation industry. Despite its female-centric plot,<i> Brave</i> was written by Pixar’s usual male staff, and while it was originally to be directed by Brenda Chapman- the woman who had come up with the film’s original concept-Chapman was let go from the project over a year before its release over “creative differences.” Though the number of females onscreen in a movie may not be indicative of its overall diversity or progressiveness, it’s definitely a barometer for diversity where it matters most, which is behind the screen.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/11/fresh-perspective-important-female-characters-animation/pixar-movie-theory/" rel="attachment wp-att-2559"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2559 aligncenter" alt="pixar-movie-theory" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/pixar-movie-theory-300x178.jpg" width="300" height="178" /></a></p>
<p>While Pixar has been taking small steps forward in recent years (<i>Brave, Finding Dory</i>)Pixar is going nowhere fast in its inclusion of diversity in creative positions, such as writing and directing. What Siede’s article does not get to touch on is the fact that 0 of Pixar’s 14 films were directed by women, and only two of them have been co-written by them (one of which is <i>Finding Dory</i>, which has yet to be released).  The inclusion of women in meaningful behind-the scenes roles makes all the difference in the characters and messages present in the work,  and that’s why we at Fusion believe what we do is so important. Filmmakers want to produce stories that they are passionate about, and our passions come from our experiences. Living as a woman is an experience no male director has ever had, and regardless of the subject matter, each female filmmaker adds a touch of her own perspective wherever she handles the material. When we settle for less diversity than is possible in our films, and go to the theater year after year to see movies written and directed by white, American men, we’re going to start sensing a degree of homogeny in the perspectives being presented, regardless of the skill of the storytellers. Though the stories of two monster roommates who collect screams and a rat who trains a hopeless chef to five-star skill have nothing in common on the surface, they are, on some level, nontraditional telling of a traditional story of male friendship, as are most of Pixar’s wonderful offerings. The formula has worked for Pixar in the past, but white, male perspective is limited.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/11/fresh-perspective-important-female-characters-animation/finding_dory_38938/" rel="attachment wp-att-2560"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2560 aligncenter" alt="Finding_Dory_38938" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Finding_Dory_38938-300x150.jpg" width="300" height="150" /></a></p>
<p>While I love Ratatouille, I have to agree with the film’s own Anton Ego when he calls for “<i>some fresh, clear, well-seasoned perspective</i>.”  I can’t help but wonder what it would be like to see an animated film about friendship, be it male/male, female/female, or something different altogether, being told by a woman. Good female representation onscreen will come from female power behind it, and when a woman has the opportunity to lend her experiences to a world, her influence will touch the story in a more meaningful way than a male filmmaker writing in a few more females for diversity’s sake. The same goes for the representation of any minority, whether racial, sexual or religious.</p>
<p>Now, since Pixar is just one part of the trifecta that I see controlling the American animation market, I took it upon myself to do some research into the track records the two other giants, Disney and Dreamworks, and the results were as follows: Disney animation’s first female director was Jennifer Lee on 2013’s <i>Frozen</i>, and the studio has featured female writers on their staff regularly since 1991’s <i>Beauty and the Beast. </i>Dreamworks has done better in the directorial department, with <i>Prince of Egypt, Shrek, Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, Shark Tale </i>and<i> Kung Fu Panda 2</i> all being female-directed. However, not a single Dreamworks animated feature has had a female screenwriter. On one hand, both Disney and Dreamworks seem to be pointed in the correct direction for diversity, much moreso than Pixar. Notably, both Dreamworks and Disney have movies in production featuring a Black American and Polynesian girl as their respective main characters, both films are being produced by women, and Disney’s <i>Moana</i> boasts a writer who is a New Zealander of Polynesian descent. On the other hand, neither of the two have female writers or directors, nor is the amount of women in the records of all three studios anything too impressive. In 2014, I can think of only one major American animated film this year with a female in a major production role, which is Laika Studio’s <i>The Boxtrolls, </i>written in part by Irena Brignull.</p>
<p>In my first screenwriting class at NYU last spring, I learned fairly quickly what the real strengths of animated filmmaking are. When someone presented an idea and was told “you could animate this,” what their classmate meant was that their idea was so imaginative, so fantastic, that it would be hurt by the limitations of live-action budgets, sets or physics. This limitless facet of animation is also what makes it so enticing to children, who do not have to grapple with their pride when they profess their endorsement of a film about talking cars. The executives in the animation industry are used to going up against people who believe that the genre is lesser simply because children are often the most vocal consumers, and proud to flaunt their boundless imagination.  It’s disheartening to have to fight these same executives on the need for change, when we know that the target audience has already proved their acceptance of situations that are nowhere near as seated in reality as “a woman writes a relatable story.”  In a world where we’ve long accepted the influence of magic spells and talking animals, it’s time to accept the hand of women who have been waiting a century to lead us to our happy ever after.</p>
