				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many of our friends and fans out there, when I think of Fusion I think of talent, creativity, collaboration, inspiring women and artists, amazing work, and a three day intake of vast amounts of Luna Bars (so much so that I have discovered exactly which combination makes the best course of meals &#8211; I suggest going from Oatmeal Raisin, to a Peanut Honey Pretzel and topping it off with a Caramel Nut Brownie for dessert; if a Carrot Cake sneaks its way in, we&#8217;ll just call it Dessert Act II).</p>
<p>We are so thankful to our sponsors at Luna for empowering women and also providing us with yummy, and healthy, treats to power our way through three days of amazing Fusion events. And gentlemen, they&#8217;re not just for ladies; there is no shame in munching on a Blueberry Bliss between Docs-In-The-Works and Women in Animation.</p>
<p>But this year at the 2014 festival, we have so many great food options that attending for the free treats becomes almost as tantalizing as attending for the amazing programs!</p>
<p>After Women in Animation, Friday at 7pm in Tisch 006, Chloe&#8217;s Soft Serve Fruit will be providing us with a sweetly divine sundae bar &#8211; and all of their soft serve flavors are simply fruit, water, and a touch of cane juice, making them not only vegan-friendly but also all of the fun of sundaes without the guilt.</p>
<p>Our friends at &#8216;Wichcraft are graciously catering our brunch with Susan Margolin, an intimate discussion with a marketing and distribution powerhouse, with mid-morning conversation powered by delicious (and healthy; we care about you all, can you tell?) sandwiches, granola, coffee, and more. Also, our friends at Neuro Water plan to help keep the conversation stimulating, and hydrated, with their line of brain-boosting beverages.</p>
<p>We at Fusion want to invite you to come celebrate with us; and what celebration comes without some amazing treats! We would also like to thank the sponsors who have kept the Fusion Team fed and focused throughout the year &#8211; Lombardi&#8217;s Pizza, Peanut Butter Co., KuKu Canteen, Insomnia Cookies, Bob&#8217;s Bagels, and Eileen&#8217;s Cheesecake.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s no secret that the competitors of Fusion Film Festival 2014 are in the running to win some great prizes. A lot of people, however, don’t know just how great these are to a filmmaker. One of the prizes up for grabs at Fusion this year is being offered up by the renowned and innovative technology company, Adobe.</p>
<p>Adobe has generously contributed five 1-year subscriptions to the student pack of Adobe Creative Cloud to for Fusion’s winners that includes <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Illustrator</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html">InDesign</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/muse.html">Adobe Muse</a>, and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html">Adobe Premiere Pro</a>. Normally valued as a $600 bundle per subscription, the winners in the categories of Graduate Film, Undergraduate Film, Sight &amp; Sound, Animated Short, and Web-Series will take this career-shaping package home for free.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/catalog.html?promoid=JOOTH">The whole host of Adobe products</a> allow artists of the technological generation to polish and professionalize their work before putting it before clients and the public and to create overall higher quality products than their competitors. Adobe has just made further innovative shockwaves in the creative community by launching <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud/behance-community.html">Behance</a> &#8211; a product that allows creatives to showcase their portfolios electronically thereby networking faster and further by linking artists to the creative cloud.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/education/students.html?showEduReq=no">Students</a> are now able to put out professional-grade work through the use of the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/education/students/your-world-alive.html">creative cloud</a> linked to Adobe. Showcased on Adobe’s web sites are stories of talented individuls who have used Adobe products to take their work to the next level. Such artists include <a href="http://www.adobe.com/education/students/nika-tang-profile.html">Nika Tang</a>, who was able to use Adobe to launch her clothing designs into the forums of Fashion Week, and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/education/students/brecht-vanthof-profile.html">Brecht Vanthof</a> who used the Adobe Creative Cloud to craft his surf films.</p>
<p>Since its founding Adobe has always had a strong impact within the creative community and is continuously spearheading new innovations to open up doors for artists to enhance, hone, and change their crafts. Fusion is excited to announce that we have the support of Adobe in the form of five $600 value prize packages at our 2014 festival.</p>

		<title>Tips on How To Run a Festival – From Our Mentors at Nantucket</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, the Fusion Team held a workshop with our mentors at festival the Nantucket Film Festival where we talked about everything from getting sponsors to creating the perfect marketing pitch. Bill Curran, the Festival Producer, Basil Tsiokos, the Film Program Director, Nicki Doyamis and Jess Byers, the Development Manager and the festival Coordinator, respectively, made up the intimate and knowledgeable panel.</p>
<p>As is stated in their mission statement, the Nantucket Film Festival focuses on the awareness and appreciation of the art of screenwriting. Each year they honor a different screenwriter who has been exemplary in the field of screenwriting. This year, the festival is honoring Aaron Sorkin, who is best known as the screenwriter behind <em>The Social Network</em> and the creator of the television shows <em>The West Wing</em> and <em>The Newsroom</em>.</p>
<p>Along with honoring a noted screenwriter each year, the Festival also awards new voices in screenwriting who have made an impact, special achievements in documentary storytelling, and the Adrienne Shelly Excellence in Filmmaking Award, which is presented to a female involved in the creation of film who has stood out among her peers. As the awards span all aspects of screenwriting, it is clear that the Nantucket Film Festival caters to a vast audience.</p>
<p>The Festival also hosts an All-Star Comedy Roundtable each year, bringing together the top writers, directors, and performers in comedy who talk about their experiences in the field. Last year’s comedians included Ben Stiller, Mike Myers, Seth Meyers, and Michael Ian Black. While the Nantucket Film Festival is smaller in size than other film festivals, it was inspiring to hear about how this reputable festival still brought large audiences and successful writers together to celebrate screenwriting in film.</p>
<p>This year, the Nantucket Film Festival will be celebrating its 19th festival. These many years of experience gives Nantucket some great insights to share with Fusion about running a successful festival. One of their main tips is to always be professional and positive, especially when working with other companies, including those who might be sponsors for the festival. It was inspiring to hear how important a confident attitude can take you, whether you are working for a major film festival like Nantucket Film Festival or a student run festival like Fusion.</p>
<p>In terms of advertising for and marketing the festival, the Nantucket panel advised to take a cue from social media and connect events that were happening in popular culture with events that Fusion was involved in. Everyone loves top-ten lists, so use Twitter or Facebook to pull people into the “Top Ten Women in Film” that they have to check out, or “The Five Must See Films of February” that have Fusion Alumni involved in them. The bottom line: Keep people interested and involved in the Festival,<br />
and always present a positive image to the public. Successful film festivals are all about teamwork and building a team that is knowledgeable, determined, and passionate about making each year the best it can be.</p>
<p>To have the chance to talk to such successful and knowledgeable insiders as the Nantucket Film Festival team was an incredible opportunity. Their insights into what makes a film festival successful were a reminder of how any festival, including Fusion, can always grow and improve to make each year the best festival yet. It was inspiring to hear from such notable people in the film festival industry, and about how as students putting on a film festival, Fusion has a lot in common with the Nantucket Festival.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We at Fusion are very excited to inform contestants, festival enthusiasts, and fellow Fusionites alike of<b> </b>more amazing news from our sponsors &#8211; Gotham Sound has teamed up with the festival again to sponsor some incredible prizes. The company has generously offered five $200 certificates with a donation value of $1,000.</p>
<p>Gotham Sound and Communications, Inc. is the ideal one-stop audio shopping and service experience. The company’s services range from equipment rental to equipment repair. In addition to its<b> </b>up-to-date stock and talented technicians, Gotham’s knowledgeable staff is on hand to provide insightful advice. Whether a major studio film or a student project, Gotham Sound and Communications, Inc. is dedicated to providing reliable, expert support. Check out this real-life scenario, straight from the Gotham blogs, to see just how Gotham tools can aid you in resourceful filmmaking:</p>
<p>“Suppose you have a certain high profile talent who has a kooky idea for a show. He wants to take classic cars, pick ­up other high profile talent, drive them around the city (stopping at various locations), treat them to coffee, and drive them back home – all while seamlessly recording their entire conversation, without having a sound person present in the car as it zips around New York.</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Blog_GothamSound2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1412 aligncenter" title="Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" alt="Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Blog_GothamSound2.jpg" width="893" height="502" /></a></p>
<p>This is exactly the scenario presented to Gotham when director Jojo Pennebaker called us in 2012 about Jerry Seinfeld&#8217;s <a href="http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/" target="_blank"><b><i>Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee</i></b></a>. The stipulations were that it had to be seamless, it had to be unobtrusive, and there had to be total coverage – with no retakes. Lucky for us, Zaxcom wireless provide a unique feature set that allowed us to accomplish exactly this.”</p>
<p>Read more on how Gotham met the challenge of the in-car-mike on Gotham’s <a href="https://www.gothamsound.com/news/comedians-cars-getting-wired">blog</a>.</p>
<p>For Fusion winners, Gotham is an incredibly useful tool in creating independent projects. The rental inventory is diverse enough for any sized project and budget, from an Intermediate Narrative production<b> </b>to a first feature. Getting an independent project underway can be difficult, but the support of Gotham and their technical wizards can make the entire process a great deal easier, just like they did for Jerry Seinfeld.</p>
<p>Be sure to attend the Student Showcase and Award Ceremony at Cantor Film Center<b> </b>on Saturday, March 8<sup>th</sup> at 7pm to find out who will win this great prize.</p>
