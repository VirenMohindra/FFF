<p>Shelley Page is an awe-­inspiring woman with an extraordinary career in the animation industry. She was one of the original Dreamworks Animation team members and is now Dreamworks&#8217; Head of International Outreach. In addition to working in the field herself, she reaches out to young artists in search of new talent and storytellers for the future. After giving a presentation at NYU Tisch, she spoke with us about her career and her advice to aspiring animators.</p>
<p><em><strong>What drew you to animation?</strong></em></p>
<p>Actually I got into animation completely by accident. I started off as an illustrator, but I was very lucky to be offered a job doing some graphic design for a project that was directed by one of the great legends of animation, Richard Williams. After I worked for him for a little while as a graphic designer, he offered me a job.</p>
<p>As an illustrator I had spent many years doing things like children’s book illustration, packaging illustration, [and] costume design for theatre. But it was only when I started working for Richard Williams, and I saw my artwork begin to move, that I got addicted to the idea that illustration could be something more than a two-­dimensional thing. It could be a storytelling device in three­-dimension.</p>
<p><em><strong>What have been some of your favorite projects that you’ve worked on?</strong></em></p>
<p>There are many, many things that have been very special to me, for different reasons. I have to say, of all the Dreamworks projects, <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> was the special one for me. But from a career point of view, it was probably <em>Shrek</em> ​because I was part of the original development team, and it was such an amazing experience being surrounded by this extraordinary group of artists, developing something that became like a household property years later.</p>
<p><em><strong>How did you become involved with Dreamworks Animation?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well, I would love to say it was a deliberate career choice, but in fact, when I was working for Richard Williams, he was already being approached by the Walt Disney Company to set up a studio to make <em>W​ho Framed Roger Rabbit?</em>,​ so we sort of became part of the Disney studio even though we were based in London. When <em>R​oger Rabbit</em> ​concluded and the studio wound down, Steven Spielberg ­ who was the executive producer ­decided to keep the team together. He set up his Amblimation studio and I was asked to become head of backgrounds there, but after making two or three films at the London-­based Amblimation, it was difficult for Steven to work so far away from his team. Some things fell into place, a new animation studio was created in L.A, and ​t​he core team from London was actually invited to come over and become Dreamworks Animation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div title="Page 2">
<p><em><strong>You are now the Head of International Outreach at Dreamworks. How did you obtain this position, and what do you enjoy most about it?</strong></em></p>
<p>Well it’s a similar story in a way because the role didn’t exist until I took it on. We had recruiters who went out into the field looking for particular artists, but we didn’t really have anybody who was engaging with the schools and universities. So, some years back, we set up the Outreach department at Dreamworks. But by this time I had moved back to London and thus was given the task of being involved with the international schools, universities, film festivals, [and] some studios. I became the international eye of [Dreamworks] out there. So the job essentially joined me; I didn’t really join the position. After a while, it’s become a more formalized role where I’m really the point person for first contact with all universities that we hope to recruit new talent from in the future.</p>
<p><em><strong>You also created the “Eye Candy Show.” What inspired its creation?</strong></em></p>
<p>It was sort of accidental because in the early days when I was bringing exciting new work back from my travels in Europe and around the world, I had to bring it into the studio in my handbag. Literally my nickname was the “Mary Poppins of Animation” because I would always come in and say, “Oh, I’ve got this wonderful film. It’s just in my handbag. Let me show you.” And it was always on pneumatic tapes or VHS tapes (this is before DVDs).​ A​fter a while I thought, “This is just too time­-consuming,” so I compiled all the new work I had seen into one screening which I showed at Dreamworks, which ​b​ecame known as the “Shelley Show.” Lots and lots of people came to see that and were inspired by the work I showed. Gradually some international festivals got to hear about this screening, which I didn’t really think was unique, but it turns out there really aren’t many people doing something similar. I’ve given “Eye Candy” presentations at pretty much every major festival you can imagine in pretty much every country you can imagine. It’s sort of my traveling handbag full of new stuff.</p>
<p><em><strong>What is the most important life lesson you have learned from your work and experiences?</strong></em></p>
<p>Definitely the most important life lesson is to be open to all opportunities because if I had at any point in my professional career said &#8220;no&#8221; to something ­- because it was either too big a challenge or it was relocating or it was so much time for not much money &#8211; ­ if I had said “no” to any of those things I definitely wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing today. But because I’m curious and like to challenge myself and am endlessly fascinated with what other people are doing, I was able to develop a career for myself that didn’t exist before. The life lesson is to accept the challenges that come your way and don’t hesitate. Even if you’re intimidated by something or you think it’s beyond your capabilities, you never know till you try, and I’ve always taken the role of having a go.</p>
</div>
<div title="Page 3">
<p><em><strong>You have so many remarkable achievements. What do you look forward to achieving in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>I used to joke that if they ever discover life on Mars, I’ll be on the next spaceship saying, “Have you got any good animation schools out here?” I’m sure that Russia is on my horizon because I’ve already been to the Putin Mito out there, and I’m really looking forward to getting involved with the animation scene in Russia. On a personal level, I’m watching my son who’s a creative writing major now in his final year at college. It’s interesting seeing it from the parent’s side of view for a change instead of that of the student or the professional. I’m curious to see where that will take him.</p>
<p>And I think for Dreamworks, the idea of building this enormous new facility in Shanghai is just such a fascinating opportunity. I’ve made many great friends out there, and I’m so looking forward to seeing it grow into this huge enterprise. It’ll be a place where anybody visiting Shanghai who is interested in entertainment will come to. It’s a whole new world, literally.</p>
<p><em><strong>What advice would you give to those aspiring to work in the animation field?</strong></em></p>
<p>I think when I interview people who are interested in joining this profession, I’m always looking for two things. One is obviously that special skill set because you kind of know it when you see it. It’s someone who has that extra added sparkle. There’s always those people that stand out. And for those people, my advice is to be brave, and don’t just take the first job that comes your way that might get you a foot on the ladder or earn you a living. Take the one that’s really going to push you to do things that maybe you didn’t think you were capable of because that’s how you will really know what your potential is. Don’t underplay your abilities, but also focus on where your real strengths lie, and then go for it. The sky’s the limit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><em>by Amanda Saiewitz, PR Head</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">This year’s Fusion Film Festival was jam-packed with amazing panels, incredible conversations with industry professionals, and impressive displays of student work. From our Woman of the Year Reed Morano and the Showrunner Superstars panel with Amy Sherman-Palladino and Janet Tamaro to the Student Showcase and Awards Ceremony, the three-day festival overflowed with inspiration. Fusion wouldn’t be a fraction of what it is without the support and enthusiasm of our fellow NYU students, so we asked some of the 2015 competition winners to share their Fusion experiences:</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/g7c7ymVHGXD7z7WDA1JgbpXPtjRHqHKZjwv0HM-BQ75Id3djiSCCRTGySCx27zEKTUfccG5USNfC94N-duI571JIcur_hNi_sDeKJZNvhCpr82omxrzio-PX2ZZnofCnz7KQ3A8" width="235px;" height="311px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">“Having been fortunate enough to participate in other festivals, we can&#8217;t express how exceptional Fusion is specifically, from the very beginning until the end. Between the thought-provoking discussions with industry leaders, to the final screening of bold and exciting work, Fusion is a festival that continues to break the mold and establish itself as a formidable celebration of great cinema. Writing our pilot [“Pass By Catastrophe”] was a tremendously enjoyable experience, and to have that experience recognized at a festival like Fusion, makes the process all the more richer. We have no doubt that our fellow honorees will continue to create works that truly say something; we can&#8217;t thank Fusion enough for including us among these artists.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Joseph Gerbino and Erica A. Hart, <em>Undergraduate Half-Hour Pilot</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">

<p dir="ltr">“Having Adam&#8217;s Ail honored at Fusion was phenomenal, for many reasons. It was exciting for so many people to come together to celebrate the films, and it&#8217;s so gratifying to see something I put so much of myself into recognized and appreciated.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignleft" alt="AdamsAil_screen03.jpg" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DHYmAwyQMu8oD-HkkVuPtbNrexEU1LSZrU9dkbK-a1oJ3xSsHJD16EaM6ttLLkrE1dNTpvMXk4bTYlyiSQFR40xFENKnzMyeCHbXq0M780Bz6isLDYAzB2DiKkyh3Uz8_ytF-2I" width="348px;" height="196px;" />There were a lot of nebulous emotions that went in to my film that I worked hard to communicate. It&#8217;s unreal to see all these talented people gather together through the festival and see them connect to what I made. It brings a life to the film that I never anticipated!”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“I attended workshops led by successful showrunners, networked with industry people and even won some cash for my One Hour Pilot, “The Doll House.” Who could ask for anything more? Well, I even got a meeting with an industry professional to discuss landing an agent. It was an awesome experience!”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“As an emerging female filmmaker, I think it&#8217;s incredible that Fusion creates not only a platform for women to present their work, but a community where women support other women.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I&#8217;m proud that the majority of crewmembers on my web series were women. This is not because I am a woman, but because these ladies were extremely qualified for their jobs. There&#8217;s an overwhelming amount of talented, hard-working, and passionate women at NYU and in the industry.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" alt="Synced Sequence Replaced.Still003.jpg" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/53YXUMwZxAVsf6MUaNY-hIvGXxFUsdltr9gVlpnrTgYd8KF7CxH0ID40l-5AxY81TxZZ94WBZQzQssPoqHe76I144sTRYsIQ_f-QqLXE5SfXPHx8NNtUBBPsx0sYiEeTWPO5YMk" width="335px;" height="190px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Fusion seeks out these individuals and aids greatly in getting their original, thought-provoking stories out to the public. I&#8217;m honored to be a part of an organization with such a noble mission.”</p>
<p>Emory Parker, <em>Web Series</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym4heVQzHG4&amp;list=PL9LDX3GeMUrVFx2JIxF8siw2ni4BgDOgE">Pants Role</a>)</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Fusion not only celebrates great work by female writers and directors but also engenders it: after three years as a producer working with women on their documentary pitches, I decided to apply to the Docs-in-the-Works program with my own documentary. I had been thinking about following an exciting area of science for years &#8211; Hydrogen fuel cell technology &#8211; which will allow cars everywhere to run cleanly and will ween us off our dependence on foreign oil. The great thing about Fusion is that it not only supports women in the arts, but projects with social significance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I filmed a week of this project &#8211; my first documentary, Oil and Water &#8211; and submitted it to the Fusion Film Festival. Working with the talented documentary professor and Fusion liaison, Nilita Vachani, I sculpted my trailer and did a live 20-minute pitch to execs at HBO, VICE, POV, Chicken &amp; Egg and Impact Partners. This was more than just a pitch session: I could see palpable excitement in the audience for this subject matter and for the wonderful scientists behind it like Harry Gray. I am continuing to develop this project and film over the next 5 years as Dr. Gray and his fellow scientists attempt to bring this technology to the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignright" alt="test tube.png" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wtDFsFBxhie1RrjY1rsSTSE07Ay_mTPYh0zKikBFl8RX951LOq2MLcJecO1rif5ukVR0t7kBE3rzrXs6wlp7aa1bkxYmjhXjc3CsGigRTpbVDT-OZhtyFNxG8hcDTTnT9BZEwlI" width="285px;" height="161px;" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to winning the documentary film pitch competition, I also had the fortune to win the half-hour comedy TV contest with my pilot &#8220;Dating by Numbers.&#8221; There&#8217;s nothing like deadlines to help finish a project! And participating in Fusion seemed like the perfect place to start shopping my script around. I&#8217;m so glad I did, and it&#8217;s been such a great experience to be part of this festival and have the support of other kick-ass women in this industry!”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By AlHanouf Al Tamimi, PR Staff Writer</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">     The 2015 Fusion Film Festival is here and all I can think about is my excitement for my first Fusion Festival. We, as the Fusion family, can’t mask how thrilled we are about this year’s panels and events, but personally, I can’t wait to be in the same room as Amy Sherman-Palladino, the creator (and executive producer) of Gilmore Girls tomorrow!</p>
<p dir="ltr">     This woman kept the lives of the many mother/daughter duos quite entertained and, in some ways, motivated us to have the qualities of both smart and driven Rory and spontaneous Lorelai. Growing up, Gilmore Girls was the show to watch for their famously unique mother/daughter relationship. Lorelai and Rory made each and every one of us want that same crazy mother in our lives (if we didn’t have one already!). If you’re fangirling right now, you probably know the ending of Gilmore Girls and how Amy Sherman-Palladino was not involved in the last season, leaving us all confused and somewhat upset about the ending. Had she been involved, many believed the final ending would have differed immensely and had more of a bang. In the end, though, I honestly believe that Gilmore Girls will remain on the list of classic TV series to binge watch for many women and men, too (can’t forget the male GG fans out there!).</p>
<p dir="ltr">     Sherman-Palladino is extraordinary when it comes to creating good television. Her talent in creating witty conversations, presenting diverse family dynamics, and writing hilarious comedy in Gilmore Girls captured the hearts of many viewers. The showrunner perceives her talent to be writing for great actors/actresses and it’s one of the defining attributes behind her success in both Bunheads and Gilmore Girls. She creates characters that truly leave a mark in the lives of many individuals, be it due to a personal connection to the characters or seeing the character as a friend after watching all 7 seasons. Her attention to detail in preparing lines for Lorelai, Rory, Paris, Michel, Sookie, Luke, Miss Patty, Mrs. Kim, Richard and Emily Gilmore and everyone else on Gilmore Girls proves her talent for breathing life into fictional characters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">     One very important piece of advice she’s put out into the world was via her interview with Refinery29:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center">     &#8221;It&#8217;s very simple. Women have to hire women. Women have to trust women. Women have to stop competing with women. This whole business is about competing. And women have made great strides, but there is still a boys&#8217; club feeling of &#8216;we&#8217;re all on the same team&#8217; that women don&#8217;t subscribe to, quite yet. And, I think it&#8217;s getting better, but it&#8217;s twofold: First, women need to sit around not talking about being women. If you have to be better than the men to get ahead, just be better. Work harder, get it, succeed, and then be in the position to do that for other people. Because that&#8217;s what men did.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">     This is a piece of advice we, as the Fusion team, look up to; celebrating women in film, television, and new media is our main priority. These are words of wisdom for any females out there trying to push themselves to become better, aspiring to be showrunners, and for those just trying to pave their way to becoming successful women in the field.</p>
<p dir="ltr">     Luckily, this inspirational writer-director-producer has gone on to pave the way for more shows after her hit series Gilmore Girls and created another entertaining TV series called Bunheads. If you don’t know it already, you should. She’s spoken about not wanting to create mediocre television and has proved herself to be nowhere near mediocre with list of successes. Sherman-Palladino went above and beyond with Gilmore Girls and is an inspiration to many women wanting to break into the film and television industry, so we are in no doubt ecstatic about her presence at the 2015 Fusion Film Festival.</p>
<p dir="ltr">     In honor of Amy Sherman Palladino (and my addiction to Gilmore Girls) here are some fun GIFs that sum up what Gilmore Girls has taught us fans and how it represents us all on a daily basis. And be sure to check out the Showrunner Superstars panel on Saturday February 28th at 2:30 p.m. in Tisch Theater 006!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">5. What I think about in the middle of class:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MLRbIlSS2Sq88NtQKjpRr4CEJgLXXMnGnAWcoGDfhODmIaK17k9pksE2Tjc9gJGCt45g2VoNKNUHBrgX2J3onAPG1_xGXRv6BP8UwsQHLKoIJMJCSSEx8FUr1ZDoG8UenwHUYI0" width="452px;" height="254px;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">6. How I’m going to act if Amy Sherman-Palladino (or Reed Morano, or any of the fabulous ladies coming to speak to the audience at Fusion) looks my way:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KoQT91ogyPudfvZ9XZIm-0FBTvfhOpNrTy_bD4cJYZOFhaRhHByNWmpxh21_RbiT8e4U12UPzH8xwDF8Z7CobPblcd-IdDoLkN1QN8xlFb2GD0Q-PcIo9ElBvho9J3MoAg6ZEGo" width="449px;" height="254px;" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">9. What the show taught me in a couple of GIFs:</p>

<p dir="ltr">You will always need your mother no matter what (let’s not get too emotional, please).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/puaEt5p61A0C_KCnzzBytUvK3Z9TUf2ZrZZE1HW6qb5ibLPsZOy_XAyqkiXyqUtKUcro6OYfIC-pLkQxWd_Knvvp3_xjKavm7dcOI05Xo4RAHRqBp3H8I0NnKdbyOfdn81W3Kx4" width="500px;" height="364px;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">No matter how different you are, you’ll most probably end up resembling your mother in many ways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FKTBsANN2KWySPdHJj0faYBNiu4d7Q436DeZhW3RAKe3WRFdHm70E-MHNeoS7YbJKp9zqVA--IdXMKS7vq-QpDtWme65JW3bESkdIBgCx_O5_eWl2nWJSD77u2ykcsqyTZxx0qw" width="500px;" height="292px;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’ve learned to come into terms with reality and just let it be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lastly, I’ve learned to find motivation within and not rely on others as much as someone like Paris (minus her life coach moments that is).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">10. Finally, this is a conclusion to all of the above, as it represents how I felt when the show ended:</p>

<p><i>by Siena Richardson, Editorial Staff Writer</i></p>
<p>We had the opportunity to interview Liz Lapadula, Fusion Film Festival sponsor and owner of Kopi Kopi, a Greenwich Village cafe and craft coffee bar specializing in Indonesian coffee and food.</p>
<p>Starting March 2nd, Kopi Kopi will be open from 6am-10pm Monday-Thursday, 6am-11pm Friday, 8am-11pm Saturday, and 8am-10pm Sunday. 8 W 3rd St, New York, NY 10012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fusion: Could you tell us the origin story of Kopi Kopi</b>?</p>
<p><b>Liz:</b> I learned about coffee just three or four years ago because I happened to go to Indonesia and my sister, who’s a chemist, invited me to this coffee shop. Before, I’d never been that interested in coffee. The way I drank it, I’d just put milk and a lot of sugar and then everything tastes the same. So I actually asked the farmer, “Can you really taste the difference?” And he said yes, but you have to drink it black. So that’s when I started tasting espresso so I could differentiate the taste. And I looked at it from a science perspective, “Oh this one’s more aromatic, so it tastes different.”</p>
<p>You know, growing up in Indonesia, there are so many different types of coffee that you don’t really appreciate it. And then I went back and I realized there are seven different known origins of Indonesian coffee but not that many people know about it. For example, you go to Starbucks and you say, “Okay, Sumatran coffee.” But probably a lot of people don’t know where Sumatra is. So from there I learned about coffee, and that it’s very interesting. And so I thought, “How would I promote this delicious Indonesian coffee and cuisine?” And my son and my husband graduated from NYU, and this is just an ideal place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fusion: How has your background in pharmacology and law influenced your business?</b></p>
<p><b>Liz: </b>Well, my background is science… I have a degree in chemistry and I look at coffee from a science perspective. Coffee is more complex than wine. It’s more aromatic, depending on how you roast it. I think roasting coffee is basically just like a science experiment, seeing what brings out the flavors of certain coffees. When I got interested in coffee, I went to barista school in Indonesia, and then to American Barista School in Portland, which is the center of coffee for the whole world. And I also learned roasting from a local roaster here, just briefly. But in terms of food, I’ve always loved to cook and I learned from Chef Henry Alexie Bloem, a judge from <i>Top Chef: Indonesia</i>. So I’m also the UN Ambassador for the Indonesian Chef Association, and the goal is to promote Indonesian cooking.</p>
<p>My background is also environmental law, so I like to focus on sustainability. I think it’s very important. I mean, we’re responsible to future generations. Especially because I have four kids; I want to make sure they have a good future. Every once in a while, if I go to Indonesia, I visit some of the coffee farms too because I think that it’s important.</p>
<p><b>Fusion: What have been some of the challenges of starting a business?</b></p>
<p><b>Liz:</b> Well, I don’t have any business experience per se. But you know, I took classes, I talked to people who have experience in managing restaurants. And I go to Indonesia eight times a year to talk to the suppliers and also people in the hospitality business so I learn how their business model works. But of course, you know it’s always a challenge. Rent is high. And of course a lot of people still think we’re just a coffee shop, just coffee and pastries. So we are telling people just come in. I mean you wouldn’t expect it to be this big, so people don’t realize we have a full kitchen. It’s a challenge, trying to tell people we have good food here. We have full staff and we’re open till 11 o’clock in the evening. And we just started Seamless delivery. I also just introduced something called Kopi Express, kind of boldly saying, “Fifteen minutes or it’s free” for a rice dish (grilled chicken or vegetarian tofu scramble) or the satay chicken wrap. And it comes with a cookie and a drink. You can try our fried rice, which is number two in the world just on the go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fusion: What has been rewarding so far about running Kopi Kopi?</b></p>
<p><b>Liz:</b> I love to interact with students. It’s funny because some Indonesian and Asian students think of me as their mentor. Everyone calls me “aunt.” It’s so interesting because in the morning, it’s a different dynamic with all the professors and students. And now, on the weekends, we have tourists. I just like that interaction. I think coffee is a language of itself basically, across all barriers. You can sit down with anyone and have a cup of coffee. And that’s what I’d like to have Kopi Kopi as, more of a cultural center, where you also enjoy coffee and good food. So if you go to other coffee shops, okay, it’s nice coffee, but that’s what I’d like the ambience to be here. The artwork, this is a donation from the UN Mission, it’s a three-dimensional carving that tells the story of the Mahabharata epic. And the other small pieces I brought myself from Indonesia, glass paintings painted from the back, and batik stamps, and an old antique iron. I haven’t completed it yet, but I want to have a textile wall where I display different designs of batik fabric.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-3004" alt="Latte Art" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Latte-Art.jpg" width="900" height="608" /></p>
<p><b>Fusion: Your Indonesian coffee is so delicious, and such a unique product to focus on. Can you tell us more about it?</b></p>
<p><b>Liz:</b> So our cappuccino, for instance, is basically four different types of Indonesian coffee. It starts with ten Indonesian green beans, the unroasted coffee. From ten then I roast it at three different levels: light, medium, dark. I work with the roaster for ten hours. Then from there, I have to taste every single one of them myself because I have a specific taste in mind. So it’s very involved. I think this is the only café that focuses on Indonesian coffee in the US, and we have the three highest end machines in one location. So I’m serious about my coffee. If only I had fifty hours a day, I would be extra serious.</p>
<p>We have other specialty drinks. For example, especially in the winter we have Ginger Brew, made of all fresh ginger with palm sugar. It’s delicious. There’s another one called Bandrek so like ginger, palm sugar, cinnamon clove and chile for a little spiciness. The food here is good. It’s something different. There’s a speckled layer cake. It’s definitely more of a Dutch influence but it’s seventeen layers. You make it a spoonful at a time, which is very tedious so that’s very expensive. But then the other thing that’s very unusual is the Pisang Molen, which NYU students call the banana burrito. It’s banana, cheese and chocolate, inside a French pastry, so there’s a Dutch influence as well. It’s something different.</p>
<p><b> </b><img class="alignnone  wp-image-3001" alt="Drink" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Drink.jpg" width="900" height="608" /></p>
<p><b>Fusion: Can you tell us more about the food and other drinks on your menu?</b></p>
<p><strong>Liz:</strong> A lot of people ask more about Indonesian food, because it’s relatively unknown here. We have the number one, number two in the world according to CNN Travel rundown, and then domestically. But then sometimes students miss certain foods so we make an Indonesian version. We have the Kopi taco but with an Indonesian twist: Indonesian hot sauce. And we try to make everything from scratch, so there’s no MSG and everything is made with fresh ingredients. We have a beer tap and we decided since we have craft coffee, we wanted to have craft beer and craft wine. So everything’s made in small batches and we have a relationship to the farmers.</p>
<p>We changed our business model starting two weeks ago. This used to be a café all day long. But since people asked us, saying they’d like to taste more Indonesian food, we changed. In the evening basically people don’t bring laptops, there’s more tables for dining. I think it’s good, introducing different types of drinks as well, whether alcoholic or non-alcoholic. I don’t know where the NYU professors go after work, so I’d like it to be a place where they can just wine and dine. Because if you go to a bar, it’s just too noisy, and I want it to be a nice ambiance.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-3002" alt="Chicken Satay" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Chicken-Satay.jpg" width="900" height="608" /></p>
<p><b>Fusion: How has it been working with your son?</b></p>
<p><b>Liz:</b> My son, who’s an NYU graduate, is a marine, and he’s also my business partner. But now he’s deployed as a second Lieutenant. But we do Facetime and I ask him questions. I’ll say, “Oh, we just installed a beer tap. What else do you think people would like?” And he’s a trainer at CrossFit, so he eats healthily. So I make sure we always have almond milk for cappuccinos, and salads, and everything is freshly made. When you’re in college people just want to indulge, but I want kids to eat healthy food so that’s what I like to prepare also, foods that are healthy and fresh.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Fusion: Do you have any advice for young women aspiring to jumpstart their own careers and projects, be it a business, a film, or something else?</b></p>
<p><strong>Liz:</strong> Well, you have to do a lot of planning. Number one, I would look for a mentor first. Of course, people think it’s fun, and I mean, it is fun but it’s a lot of work. I would definitely look for a mentor first. Just have a lot of discussions, ask a lot of questions, like “how many hours do you spend a day?” Because they’ll probably say, “I’m not going to spend twelve or sixteen hours a day.” And so you have to be really passionate about it. If you’re passionate about it, if it makes you happy, just go for it. I’ve been a scientist, I’ve been an attorney, and this is completely different. It’s a lot of hard work, but I think it’s rewarding because it’s about getting to know people, meeting people with different backgrounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fusion: You’ve worked with some really impressive organizations in the past- from the UN Indonesian Mission, serving the Secretary General, to the NYU Entrepreneurs festival, to the Yale Club. Kopi Kopi seems a great fit for Fusion- they both emphasize fluidity and progressiveness. What attracted you to Fusion?</b></p>
<p><strong>Liz:</strong> Well, Kopi Kopi is a family business and woman-owned business, so it&#8217;s just a perfect synergy.And with NYU students there’s an interaction with different nations, different kinds of people. I love New York because New Yorkers like to experiment, try different foods, go different places. So I think this is a good opportunity to introduce the first Indonesian coffee because we are the fourth largest producer of coffee in the world. And Indonesian coffee is very delicious, and the farmers work very hard but there’s just not enough publicity about Indonesian coffee. When you go to the Specialty Coffee Association, they just don’t have the right presentation. But now, we’ve developed this nice espresso blend, which is delicious, on an Italian coffee machine. I’d like to introduce Indonesian coffee, discuss it as more of an intercultural conversation. That’s what intrigued me, and I think being here, right across from NYU, bridging all cultures, is the perfect opportunity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><em>by Daniella Duarte, Editorial Staff Writer</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/?attachment_id=2727" rel="attachment wp-att-2727"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2727 aligncenter" alt="reed2" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/reed2-300x148.jpg" width="300" height="148" /></a></em>This year, we are honoring cinematographer and director Reed Morano as our Woman of the Year for her astonishing body of work, as well as her induction into the legendary cinematographer’s guild, The American Society of Cinematographers. Reed is one of only 14 women of the approximately 350 active members in the organization, and is also youngest member to ever be admitted. Her work includes <em>Little Birds</em>,<em> For Ellen</em>, <em>Kill Your Darlings</em>,<em> The Skeleton Twins</em>, and her upcoming directorial debut,<em> Meadowland</em>, which she also shot.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2728 aligncenter" alt="Storyboard_Kill_Your_Darlings_15" src="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Storyboard_Kill_Your_Darlings_15-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Among many of Reed’s accomplishments in film, she was honored with the 2011 Kodak Vision Award for cinematography at the Women in Film Crystal + Lucy awards, and in past years has been named one of Variety&#8217;s &#8220;10 Cinematographers to Watch,&#8221; one of Ioncinema.com&#8217;s “American New Wave 25,&#8221; and one of five innovative cinematographers in ICG Magazine&#8217;s “Generation Next&#8221; spotlight. In 2012, Reed&#8217;s work was featured in Indiewire&#8217;s “On the Rise &#8217;12: 5 Cinematographers Lighting Up Screens in Recent Years&#8221; and was named an Indiewire “Heroine of Cinema” twice in 2 years. Some of Reed&#8217;s thoughts on the digital revolution and how it has affected filmmaking are featured in Keanu Reeves&#8217; acclaimed documentary Side by Side. She also earned the honor to be featured in Kodak&#8217;s long-running OnFilm series.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Equally impressive, Reed has become a mainstay of the Sundance Film Festival; <em>Frozen River</em> won the Grand Jury prize at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and went on to be nominated for two Academy Awards (Best Actress for Melissa Leo and Best Screenplay) and seven Independent Spirit Awards, including Best Picture. The film received critical acclaim with film critic Hiram Lee mentioning “The necessary attention has been paid to seemingly small but ultimately meaningful details, and the camera of Hunt and cinematographer Reed Morano lingers just long enough on the right things—a face, the interactions between two children—to allow us time to think about what&#8217;s playing out before our eyes.” Audiences in Park City have also seen the premieres of <em>Little Birds</em>, which competed at the 2011 festival, <em>Shut Up and Play the Hits</em>, a feature-length documentary about the band LCD Soundsystem that premiered at the 2012 festival, and<em> For Ellen</em>, which also debuted at the 2012 festival in the dramatic competition.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In 2014, audiences were treated to two more of her projects—the hugely successful <em>The Skeleton Twins</em>, a black comedy starring Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader, directed by Craig Johnson and co-written by Mark Heyman (<em>Black Swan</em>), and <em>War Story</em>, a dark drama filmed in Sicily starring Catherine Keener and Sir Ben Kingsley, directed by Mark Jackson (<em>Without</em>). Both of these films premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2014. Also released this year were the cult 35mm and 65mm dark drama <em>Autumn Blood</em>, shot in the Tyrolean Alps in Austria, starring Sophie Lowe and Peter Stormare, and Rob Reiner&#8217;s latest feature, <em>And So It Goes</em>, starring Michael Douglas and Diane Keaton (her second collaboration with Reiner). In January of 2014, HBO premiered the first season of its new original series, <em>Looking</em>, shot masterfully by Reed and directed by Andrew Haigh (<em>Weekend</em>).</p>

<p dir="ltr">More recently, Reed began production on her first feature as both director and DP (not to mention editor); the dark drama <em>Meadowland</em> features a murderer’s row of talent from Olivia Wilde and Luke Wilson to Giovanni Ribisi and Elisabeth Moss. Moreover, Reed is generously leading the charge on a movement to control motion interpolation AKA &#8220;the soap opera effect&#8221; on our HDTVs. Reed&#8217;s <a href="http://change.org/">change.org</a> petition is supported by 10,500 signatures and has gained significant momentum, attracting the attention of both the film and technology communities. The petition reflects her passion for the industry, and the value of her work and the work of other DPs.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Fusion greatly admires Reed for her talent, tenacity, and forward-thinking mentality. In a male-dominated industry, she’s more than proven her mettle and integrity, asserting, “I do not want to be treated special or differently because I’m a woman and I’m a DP. That’s what I’ve fought so hard for my entire career. I can do my job just as well as the next guy.” Further proving her commitment to the art, she even filmed <em>Little Birds</em> while seven months pregnant!  Fusion also looks up to Reed because of her familiar origins &#8211; she graduated from NYU’s Kanbar Institute in 2000 and accredits much of her young enthusiasm for cinematography to Professors Michael Carmine, David Irving and Rick Litvin. Following graduation, Reed paid it forward as an adjunct cinematography professor, co-instructing the first Advanced Television classes that NYU offered.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Currently, Reed lives in Brooklyn, New York with her husband and two children. Her reel can be found <a href="http://vimeo.com/57217479">here</a>. We thank Reed for her tremendous dedication to the art and for providing a hugely positive role model.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Congratulations to Fusion’s Woman of the Year, Reed Morano!</p>
