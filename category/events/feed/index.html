				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Docs-In-The-Works competition at Fusion is a yearly institution, but also perhaps our most misunderstood event to audiences &#8211; that is, until they witness it for themselves. The pitch competition is unlike any other, it&#8217;s an immersive experience that is both educational and professional, beyond what a classroom can offer. The woman behind this event, award-winning documentarian of the Grand Prize at the Festival dei Popoli and current Tisch professor Nilita Vachani, describes it as a &#8220;doorway into the real world [of filmmaking].&#8221;</p>
<p>Five finalists have already been chosen whose in progress documentaries show great promise in how they construct a powerful story through the documentary medium. All of them are in the running to win some very practical awards in completing their projects &#8211; including, Final Draft 9, Gotham Sound, VideoBlocks Subscription, and a WMM’s Workshop Pass. This Friday they will each have 10 minutes to pitch their documentaries and screen their trailers and 10 minutes to field a Q&amp;A from a panel of esteemed executives from at HBO, Independent Film Project, History Channel, Impact Partners, POV, and Chicken &amp; Egg Pictures.</p>
<p>Yet, as Nilita describes the event, it is &#8220;not just people sitting in chairs and talking. It&#8217;s a rapid fire Q&amp;A that delves into story, characterization, narration, potential audiences, and much more.&#8221; The session can be just as exciting for the audience as the work shown; Nilita notes that &#8220;the panel often disagrees with each other, which makes it more interesting&#8221; given that all of the story conventions discussed do ultimately &#8220;depend on taste.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, there are things the competitors can do in preparation to elevate their project to a level of refined, while still raw, taste before the pitch. Nilita coaches all of the finalists for weeks before the competition and offers some great tips, which she was more than happy to share with me so that audience members have the opportunity to learn as much as the competitors.</p>
<p>Nilita claims that often times in order to &#8220;bring out the strengths and address the weaknesses&#8221; of the project&#8221; often times &#8220;a re-edit of the trailer is required.&#8221;</p>
<div style="padding-left: 25px">The trailer shouldn&#8217;t look so slick. It needs to give a real sense of the world and still feel rough and raw. This is a film that&#8217;s crying to be made. One incredible shot will leave the audience and panelists wanting to see this story more than an over-produced edit.</div>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
In regards to pitching it is also important to bear in mind the time limit; in fact, the 20 minute pitch within the competition is another quality that grounds it in the real-world of both narrative and documentary production. &#8220;You only get 10 minutes to pitch and 10 minutes to field Q&amp;A so to maximize the exposure, what you say verbally should not be a repetition of what&#8217;s in the trailer, they should be different yet work hand in glove,&#8221; Nilita explains.</p>
<p>Audience members find themselves completely engaged in Docs-In-The-Works year after year, more so as participants than simply as flies-on-the-wall of a high-profile pitch session. This year though the array of finalists alone are enough of a draw for a diverse experience in documentary work. Four out of five of the finalists follow the true life narratives of immigration stories, though they are all handled in extremely different ways. Two of the films are on Asian immigrant experience, &#8220;both dramatically different from each other and both shatter stereotypes.&#8221; One even implements an immigration story with sections told through animation while stilling holding true to the heart of documentary storytelling.</p>
<p>The most thrilling aspect of being an audience member at Docs-In-The-Works is to witness and take part in the shaping of true works-in-progress of true stories. &#8220;These films will have a life outside of film school,&#8221; Nilita says, &#8220;as will all of us as students.&#8221; Nilita&#8217;s words hold true for Emma Thatcher, a finalist from last year&#8217;s Docs-In-The-Works who went on to complete her project as her first feature To The Moon, and Fusion winner in Undergrad Narrative Film from last year, Erin Sanger, who credits being an audience member at Docs as her inspiration for directing a her own documentary on a wounded EOD war veteran post-graduation (For more on these two wonderful Fusion filmmakers and their projects check out our blog posts on them: <a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/02/to-the-moon-and-back-with-more-emma-thatcher-2013-docs-in-the-works-finalist-completes-feature/">Emma Thatcher</a> and <a href="http://www.fusionfilmfestival.com/2014/02/fusion-past-present-erin-sanger-post-bombshell-win/">Erin Sanger</a>). Come join us this Friday at 3PM in Tisch 006 to be a part of a Fusion tradition and truly professional experience in the world of documentary pitches, which at its core is really just testing the ability to tell a worthwhile story.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>In Person with Cast for Fusion’s OPENING NIGHT Thursday, 7pm @ Cantor Film Center</h3>
<p>This week I had the privilege of speaking with writer/director Eliza Hittman, about her groundbreaking film <em>It Felt Like Love</em>, opening March 21 at IFC Center in NYC.</p>
<p>The film paints the coming-of-age of female sexuality in a boldly honest light. Hittman holds nothing back when speaking about her film’s intricate and controversial themes, and what it is like being a woman director and independent filmmaker.</p>
<p>The story she tells about the making of the micro-budgeted film, made fiercely on her own terms, is inspiring story for all young filmmakers, male and female alike. And it is a story Eliza will be happy to share more when she joins us for a Q&amp;A with cast members Gina Persanti and Giovanna Saliemeni on Fusion&#8217;s opening night March 6 at 7:00PM at Cantor Film Center. (Fusion screenings is free and seating on a first come basis.)</p>
<p><em>You&#8217;ve written in your production notes that your focus for It Felt Like Love is to show the &#8220;outtakes from childhood&#8221; and the disillusionment of a true-coming-of-age story. Do you look at Lila&#8217;s story as a cautionary tale, or more a realistic portrayal of adolescence?</em></p>
<p>There’s no moral attached to this story and it’s not a cautionary tale. It’s about a transformative borderline violent and painful moment in a girl’s life that she instigates. I think American films that deal with coming of age themes like sexual awakening tend to depict these emotions in a very generalized fashion and perpetuate myths about romantic love. I wanted to create an unsentimental film about that shatters that moment. A lot of the elements from teen movies are there, but I think and hope I subvert clichés and also the audiences’ expectations.</p>
<p><em>How did you manage to deal with sexual taboos with young actors and help them deliver such amazing performances?</em></p>
<p>I didn’t have a traditional rehearsal process for the film. I felt it was more crucial to spend time with each other and hang out before shooting. We did several read throughs of the script, but on our longest rehearsal we went to Coney Island and hung out on amusement park rides. I like the performances to be fresh when the actors get on set and feel there’s a danger in overworking dialogue that’s meant to sound very conversational and natural. To stage the scenes, I prefer to walk through them alone from the perspective of each character, to make discoveries about camera position, movement, and framing. In a sense, I act out the script by myself and then again with the cinematographer and then finally on set with the actors. Each time, I discover something new. Gina wasn&#8217;t on set for the more taboo moments. I was her body double. Those were my hardest days, Gina&#8217;s easiest.</p>
<p><em>Do you think that your bold, unsentimental approach is important for the portrayal of young female characters?</em></p>
<p>I think most people regardless of age and gender feel the pressure to represent themselves as being happy. The main character is lonely and trying to appear otherwise. Thematically, the film explores self-deception, the process of lying to ourselves and other people because the truth about ourselves or our relationships can be difficult to acknowledge. I think that&#8217;s an important character to exist on the screen. It connects audiences to that part of themselves.</p>
<p><em>How would you describe your style as a filmmaker?</em></p>
<p>Poetic Realism</p>
<p><em>What inspired the use the unexplored locations of Brooklyn&#8217;s Gerritsen Beach?</em></p>
<p><em>It Felt Like Love</em> was shot in working class neighborhoods in Brooklyn like Gravesend and Gerritsen Beach, areas that are rarely pictured in the popular imagination of the city. There’s something unfamiliar and unrecognizable about where the film takes place, and that’s what I was going for. There are parts of Brooklyn where you can get lost in nature, places I remember from my own childhood that have a certain resonance with kids. There’s a wild beauty to the landscape that I wanted to capture.</p>
<p><em>Your production notes reference NYU undergrads as interns in your camera department. What kind of learning experience did your set provide for these students who are dreaming of bringing their own independent film ideas to life?</em></p>
<p>George Itzhak and Frances Chen worked as camera assistants to our cinematographer Sean Porter. Since the crew was so small and barebones, they had a totally hands on and immersive experience. It was probably a smaller size crew then most NYU undergrad shoots. I hope it empowered them to realize they can make challenging and successful work without millions of dollars and huge crews. It&#8217;s about the quality of the story and the success of the collaboration.</p>
<p><em>As Fusion is a festival that celebrates women behind the camera, we&#8217;re always curious: what&#8217;s it like being a female filmmaker at this moment in our industry?</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s super challenging! I think unfortunately women are expected to create romantic comedies and be the next Lena Dunham and that&#8217;s the only way the industry thinks they can monetize the female voice. I&#8217;d like to make work that&#8217;s more radical and subvert those expectations.</p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="font-size: small;">Interview by Danielle Massie</span></span></p>
<p>Attend the Industry Screenings in the Cantor Film Center (36 E 8th St) at 7pm on Thursday, March 6th to hear more from Eliza and see her amazing film. Visit her <a href="http://itfeltlikelove.vhx.tv/">site</a> for more information on <em>It Felt Like Love</em>.</p>
